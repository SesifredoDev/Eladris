#  Eladris -  Half A World
## 📍 Basic Info 
- **Type:**  World

Your world is shattered. After the cosmic event known, to you, as the Sundering Veil broke the world in twain, and the threads are pulling further and further back. The worlds are resonating at different frequencies, and they can only be seen through ancient magic, and rare phenomena. The Veil between the shards is weaking, causing strange crossings, merging landscapes, and some accounts have said that even time itself has been distorted.

Explore this version of Eladris, and the people who inhabit this oddly chaotic world. Establish yourselves and explore the beliefs of the different factions, and how they think the shattering should be handled.

You can choose to join the Crentreg, an organisation that investigate notable phenomena regarding the shards, and act to protect in chaotic encounters.

The nations and countries of Eladris in an uneasy state of easy trade and existance, leaving the war of Mechanical Arcane destruction to the "Pre-Shatter" years. Tensions are high, but with every form of leaderships, from Diarchies to Republics trying to deal with unexplainable events in their own territories. The only thing that has become an unspoken agreement. The warforge are to be   left in the past.

## Non-Common Knowledge

A **Resonance Node** resonates with both the overlapping node in Irslade, and the environment near to it.  Cael’Tharyn has a primary Shard Resonance with Arcane, which makes it highly influential to arcane abilities. This can be both beneficial and negative to sages and their intent. a
It is hard to say whether the resonance is due to the people using those abilities, or if those abilities are the reason it is resonating with that type of magic/nature.
## **Factions:**

1. **[[The Veilbinders]]:** Monks and mages who seek to stabilize the Shards and restore Elaris to its original form.
2. **[[The Shardborn]]:** Individuals who thrive on the chaos, believing the fractured state brings opportunity and freedom.
3. **[[The Council of Echoes]]:** A shadowy group of beings who exist in multiple Shards at once and manipulate events across realities.
4. **[[The Cult of the Final Frequency]]:** Zealots who want to completely collapse the Veil and awaken a god-like being said to slumber in the “True Eladris.”
5. **[[Centreg]]:** A neutral investigative order operating across all major nations, tasked with identifying and responding to Echo, Veil, and Resonance-related anomalies. Trusted by most governments; known for impartiality and precision.
