## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Born during a resonance storm beneath a veiled eclipse, Zaharen and Velmion were immediately touched by the Shardwinds. One was briefly lost to the Veil and returned changed — yet no rite has revealed which one. This sacred ambiguity has shaped their reign, with neither brother claiming primacy.

Zaharen rules by day, overseeing ceremonies, trade, and diplomacy. Velmion rules by night, delivering vision-words through the Mirror Vault and dream-sealed proclamations.

Together, they oversee the Rite of Dust and Flame and maintain ritual equilibrium in a land shaped by echo and illusion.

Their child  is destined to inherit this mystery-bound legacy.

## 📝 Notes

- Zaharen is always accompanied by an Echo-Scribe who silently records his words to be mirrored by Velmion in dream.
    
- Velmion is rumored to have walked the Shardwinds bare-footed during his youth and returned with sand that still glows faintly in moonlight.
    
- They share a private rite each month in the Mirror Vault — the only time both are said to speak aloud to each other.
    
- Both monarchs have never spoken publicly about the possibility of being the Lost One — it is culturally forbidden.
    
- Despite this, they are beloved by their people, who value the mystery as sacred, not problematic.
