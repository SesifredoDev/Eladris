## 🎭 Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:**  
    Relentless, disciplined, and fiercely unsentimental. Kree views every failure of magical containment as a potential world-ending event and behaves accordingly. He speaks in clipped precision, walks with military posture, and seems to be constantly calculating angles — both physical and political. He believes in containment first, compassion second.
    
- **Flaws & Secrets:**
    
    - Kree once severed a portion of his own memory during a high-risk mission, deliberately removing the identity of a friend-turned-hostile due to Echo infection. He remembers the mission, but not the person — and the emotional fallout lingers beneath his iron facade.
        
    - Maintains a private log of restricted encounters and anomalous behavior within the Ascendancy — implying growing distrust of their judgment.
        
    - Believes the **Veiled Annex** holds more than ethical truths — he suspects it houses a contained Echo-conscience capable of influencing key decisions.
        
- **What Does He Want?**  
    To protect Druvenhal from corruption — not through violence, but through discipline, structure, and absolute clarity. He is determined to prevent the misuse of knowledge and uphold the sanctity of truth in a world that bends too easily.

## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Warden Kree rose through the ranks of the Inkguard over three decades, beginning as a rune-forger during the **Binding of the Inkwound**, where his quick deployment of counter-glyphs likely saved the Citadel’s lower tiers from recursive collapse. He later designed the **Silent Code**, a doctrine of operational silence that became law for on-duty Inkguard.

He was appointed Warden by unanimous consent — rare for a military-civil hybrid role — and has held the position ever since. Under his command, the Inkguard have become both feared and admired for their efficiency, incorruptibility, and dedication.


## 🔗 Relationships

- **Connected Characters:**
    - **[[Arch-Lexicon Thariel Vos]]** – His superior in theory, though he sometimes operates independently under emergency protocols. Mutual respect, but growing friction.
    - Maintains correspondence with **High Curate Nelyra Ves** regarding Echo-afflicted civilians deemed too unstable for Druvenhal’s containment halls.
        
- **Enemies/Rivals:**
    
    - Whisper-Mongers and rogue archivists — especially former Inkguard turned information thieves.
        
    - Some within the Archivist Ascendancy who believe his methods verge on authoritarianism.

## 📝 Notes

- Always wears partial armor, even at rest — his chestplate is inscribed with a personal binding glyph.
    
- Carries a triple-notched **Sigilbrand Seal**, modified to both encode and _overwrite_ knowledge at risk of escape.
    
- His office has no bookshelves — only blacksteel drawers labeled with silent runes and memory-locked scroll vaults.
    
- When he invokes emergency rites, his voice activates the _Chain of Retained Thought_, broadcasting focus-stabilizing resonance to nearby allies.
