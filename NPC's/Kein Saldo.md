## üìñ Backstory & Role in the Story

Kein Saldo is a foundational figure in Velquora, one of the few remaining individuals alive who remembers the city's early decades after the Shattering. As a young gnome, he was drawn to the Resonance Node's unique properties and quickly rose in both scholarly and political circles. His illusions were not about dazzle but about revelation, using deception to expose truths that raw sight would miss.

His theories on "perceptual layering" helped design the Veiled Observatory and the protective enchantments around the Obsidian Archives. In recent years, he has withdrawn somewhat from public life, preferring to act through counsel and correspondence. However, those who seek true understanding often find themselves directed‚Äîby accident or design‚Äîto Kein‚Äôs terrace library, where reality itself seems to pause for conversation.

In the broader narrative, Kein serves as a guide and moral compass. He rarely gives direct aid but provides players or characters with cryptic insights that lead them to uncover deeper truths about the planar echoes, the city's secrets, or even themselves. He may also serve as a hinge point in deciding the city's fate when the illusions that veil it begin to collapse or transform.
