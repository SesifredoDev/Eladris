## 🏛️ Basic Info
- **Role:** Noble, Figure Monarch of The republic of Begoestia
- **Race:**  Aracokra
- **Age:**  24
- **Location:**  [[Republic of Begoestia]]

## 🎭 Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:**  
    Graceful, diplomatic, and remarkably eloquent for their age, Sov Gerecht embodies the old ideals of leadership without command. They are observant, well-read in arcane history, and known to calm volatile political tempers with careful phrasing and poetic analogies. A gentle presence, yet never naïve.  
    Despite having no formal legislative power, Gerecht is often the unspoken moral compass of the Republic’s identity.
    
- **Flaws & Secrets:**  
    Internally conflicted — proud of their heritage and public role, but increasingly disillusioned with the slow erosion of noble tradition and the growing distance between the RoB Governance and the people.  
    Holds private correspondence with figures in fringe factions, including the Veilbinders and Crentreg observers, seeking insight into the deeper causes of instability.  
    Harbors suspicions that the Shardspire’s fluctuations may be responding to intentional manipulation — possibly from within the Republic itself.
    
- **What Do They Want?**  
    To maintain the spirit and unity of Begoestia without returning to the destructive authoritarianism of the Pre-Shatter monarchies. Gerecht wants to matter — not to control, but to guide, before the city they love collapses under ambition and dissonance.

## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story
> A monarch of the old house "Begoestia", and now sits a figure head without much politcal sway in the country. Though they are generally respected in their terratory, and oppinions are often taken into account, weather indirectly or directly into the debates, within recent years even common folk have realised a small animosity towards the council.
