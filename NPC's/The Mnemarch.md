## 🎭 Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:**  
    Serene, distant, and profoundly introspective. The Mnemarch carries an aura of stillness that quiets even the most chaotic minds. He speaks rarely, listens intently, and when he does speak, it’s in statements that echo with layered meaning. He remembers more lives than most have met.
    
- **Flaws & Secrets:**
    
    - His mind holds countless foreign memories — some from people long dead, some possibly not native to Eladris. These memories occasionally leak into his speech, dreams, and presence.
        
    - He has lost his own original identity; no one, including himself, knows his true name. Some suspect he removed it deliberately as part of an ancient Rite of Emptying.
        
    - In moments of magical strain or Echo surge, his selfhood can momentarily fragment — causing him to "relive" someone else's past until stabilized.
        
- **What Does He Want?**  
    To preserve the fragile continuity of the world's minds in a time when thought, memory, and time itself can unravel. He believes that if memories are threads, he can weave a pattern strong enough to hold back collapse.

## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

The Mnemarch is not a title passed down, but a mantle assumed by necessity. He is the living archive of Caldrith Vale — a being who absorbs memory fragments from those broken by Resonance or Echo trauma. He was once something else: a war-mage, a philosopher, a general — no one is certain. His transformation began during the early Shattering, when he began storing the minds of the dying to preserve their truths.

Now he resides within the **Mneme Spire**, surrounded by memory strands in crystalline suspension. He is called upon during moments of psychological collapse, to restore what was lost — or help shape new meaning from the fragments.
