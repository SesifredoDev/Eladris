## 🎭 Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:**  
    Calm, enigmatic, and deeply perceptive. Mother Revael speaks rarely, but when she does, her words are precise and laden with symbolic weight. She carries a presence of stillness even amid magical storms — her voice feels like a memory already half-forgotten, pulling at something deeper in the soul. She teaches through paradox, silence, and vision.
    
- **Flaws & Secrets:**
    
    - She is **timelost**, having drifted partially through Irslade during an Echo Event. Time passes differently for her, and her perception of cause and consequence is often reversed or blurred.
        
    - Revael may have once been a member of a powerful noble family from the Kingdom of Arilia — but she erased her identity upon taking her Veilbinding vows. Only fragments of her former life linger in her dreams.
        
    - She bears a spiritual wound from an unfinished binding — a failed attempt to save a crumbling Shard now known as the **Hollow Fold**. Her visions are sometimes infected by what remains of it.
        
- **What Does She Want?**  
    To _heal_ the world, not just restore it. Revael believes the Sundering was not simply a disaster, but a test — a call for higher spiritual understanding. Her goal is not political or territorial, but metaphysical: to prepare the people of Eladris for a unified consciousness strong enough to reweave reality.

## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Little is known of Mother Revael’s life before the Sundering, but stories tell of an elven prophetess who walked into a Resonant breach and returned decades later, changed. She founded the early teachings of the Veilbinders and is said to have received the _First Pattern_ — a vision of the True Eladris, whole and unbroken, suspended like a jewel in the Loom of Creation.

She has led the Veilbinders ever since, not through command but by presence. Her guidance has saved entire cities during planar crises and steered the Order through political pressure, schism, and near-collapse. To the outside world, she is either a mythic figure or a dangerously idealistic mystic. To the Veilbinders, she is _the Thread That Listens_.

In narrative terms, Revael may serve as a guide, a riddle-speaker, or a final test. She offers insight that is never direct, and her approval often unlocks access to Veilbinder rites, sanctums, or hidden truths.

## 📝 Notes

- Her staff, _The Still-Spindle_, is said to hum faintly when the Veil is under stress. It is not a weapon, but a tuning tool.
    
- Some claim she never sleeps — only “enters deeper layers of the thread.”
    
- During the **Binding of the Iridescent Rift**, she stood still for three days, whispering nothing but fragments of a long-lost lullaby that somehow stabilized the breach.
    
- Her eyes no longer reflect light — they reflect potential.
