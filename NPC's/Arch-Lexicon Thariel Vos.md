## 🎭 Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:**  
    Cerebral, unshakably calm, and otherworldly in presence. Vos is a master of patience and information management, speaking rarely but with surgical precision. Her tone is always measured; her gaze, penetrating. She often appears distant, as if thinking five timelines ahead. She is not cold, but she is utterly unsentimental. She believes that truth must be cultivated, pruned, and occasionally buried to preserve civilization itself.
    
- **Flaws & Secrets:**
    
    - During the **Breach of Reflection**, Vos absorbed a corrupted fragment of unstable knowledge — a truth that _should not have been known_. She ceased speaking for seven years, only communicating through sigil-arrays and mirrored notation.
        
    - She believes that true understanding of the Sundering is possible, but dangerous — and that certain truths within Druvenhal’s sealed chambers could unravel the world if exposed.
        
    - Though politically neutral, she holds private doubts about the Republic’s handling of arcane law and increasingly considers re-establishing a truth-based theocratic council — under her direction.
        
- **What Does She Want?**  
    To preserve the continuity of understanding across the Shattered world. Vos is committed to protecting facts — not information, but **verified, validated, tested knowledge** — and shielding society from truths that can collapse minds, timelines, or cities. She sees herself as a gardener of cognition.

## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Thariel Vos was born in the high libraries of pre-Sundering Arilia, and when the world broke, she survived by binding herself within a time-dilation loop inside a collapsing tower. She emerged decades later to find Eladris fractured and memory in disarray. Instead of seeking power, she sought **order** — and began the long process of rebuilding the **Archivist Ascendancy**, turning it into a guiding force of containment and clarity.

As Arch-Lexicon, she holds the highest authority over what truths are permitted to circulate through Begoestia’s academic, arcane, and legal systems. In practice, she has the power to seal books, sanction researchers, and direct containment protocols without Senate approval in moments of magical crisis.

## 🔗 Relationships

- **Connected Characters:**
    
    - **Warden Hespel Kree** – Her military counterpart in Druvenhal. They work together efficiently, but Vos often acts beyond his containment strategies.
        
    - Respected by the **Veilbinders**, though they disagree with her policy of deep truth-sealing rather than gradual unveiling.
        
- **Enemies/Rivals:**
    
    - Radical scholars in Begoestia and Tessavar Reach who accuse her of intellectual authoritarianism.
        
    - The **Cult of the Final Frequency**, who see her as the last line preventing the shattering of the Veil.

## 📝 Notes

- Wears ceremonial robes woven with reflective script that realigns itself based on the viewer’s comprehension.
    
- Communicates through sigil arrays when silence is necessary; these are said to _burn_ when viewed by those unprepared for their meaning.
    
- Maintains a sealed ledger in the **Veiled Annex** — its pages blank to most, but inked to those who "ask the right question."
    
- Has a memory palace spell constructed into the Athenaeum itself — walking its inner corridors is, in a way, walking through her thoughts.
