## 🎭 Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:**  
    Fearless, sharp-tongued, and ruthlessly pragmatic. Vintar is the kind of leader who commands respect through action, not politics. A former skyship captain turned Rift-Edge official, he walks the cliffside city with a commander’s gaze and a storm-pilot’s instincts. He balances diplomacy with intimidation — and often leans toward the latter when dealing with outside officials.  
    He’s blunt, tactical, and fiercely loyal to his crew and city.
    
- **Flaws & Secrets:**
    
    - Though publicly aligned with the Republic, Sorell often bends (or outright ignores) RoB directives when they conflict with Tessavar’s autonomy. He has a network of loyal captains who look the other way when things get murky.
        
    - He once captained the **Stormwake**, a vessel presumed lost during a Riftstorm operation. Rumors say the ship returned altered — and that he ordered its scuttling without explanation.
        
    - Keeps an unregistered Echo artifact — a **Shardwing Compass** — locked in his quarters, which occasionally points _into_ the rift.
        
- **What Does He Want?**  
    To protect Tessavar Reach from both outside control and internal collapse. He sees the city as a necessary frontier — one that must remain unshackled by bureaucracy. However, he also believes that Begoestia needs Tessavar’s boldness now more than ever, and he’ll play the political game just long enough to ensure the Reach survives.

## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Born on a tether platform during a wind surge, **Sorell Vintar** was practically raised in the sky. His mother was a shard-diver, his father a salvager, and by sixteen, Sorell had his own ship and crew. Over the next two decades, he built a reputation as one of the fastest and most daring sky captains in Begoestia.

After the **Skyship Uprising**, Sorell negotiated the fragile truce between the Reach’s independent guilds and the RoB Trade Fleet. Rather than retire, he was appointed **Skyship Marshal**, a new post created to bridge law enforcement, Riftwatch duties, and RoB Governance expectations.

## 📝 Notes

- Wears a stormcut jacket made from salvaged sky-whale hide, engraved with tether sigils.
    
- His weapon of choice is a multi-channel storm pistol that channels lightning or kinetic pulses — gifted by his old engineer, now missing.
    
- Occasionally talks to the wind — a habit from too many close calls — but some claim the wind talks back.
    
- Refuses to live in the Gildreach Anchorage; his home is tethered to the lower storm-tier, half open to the sky.
