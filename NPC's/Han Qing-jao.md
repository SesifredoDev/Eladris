## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story
> ## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story
### The Gilded Illusion

Born into the opulence of the **Tsardom of Pebopetsia**, Fey-tza spent her first two centuries believing her father was the paragon of Eladrian restoration. As a high-ranking Noble, he preached "Order" at the dinner table and "Unity" in the courts. Fey-tza worshipped his stoicism, adopting his meticulous need for control as her own. However, the veneer cracked when she discovered his private journals—not filled with plans for restoration, but with the chaotic mathematics of **The Cult of the Final Frequency**.

Her father wasn't just a Noble; he was a high-ranking architect of dissolution. He viewed his own family as merely "temporary vibrations" to be eventually silenced. The man who tucked her in with stories of a mended world was secretly funding the **Spiral Choir** to tear it apart.

### The Desperate Pivot

Reeling from the betrayal and desperate to scrub the "Han" name of its hidden filth, Fey-tza fled to the **Centreg**. She sought refuge in their structured, bureaucratic approach to governance and planar stability. She rose quickly through their ranks, using her noble breeding to navigate their hierarchies. But she soon found the Centreg’s methods to be cold and insufficient—they were treating the symptoms of the Sundering with paperwork while the wound itself continued to fester. They were too slow, too loud, and far too trusting of the very systems her father was actively subverting.

### Finding the Thread

Her "dismissive" nature eventually led her to investigate whispers of the **Veilbinders**. While the world saw them as eccentric monks, Fey-tza’s obsession with the truth revealed a deeper reality: they were the only ones actually holding the seams of existence together.

She didn't join them out of religious fervor, but out of a cold, calculated necessity for order. Her talent for control and her intimate knowledge of her father's "Final Frequency" tactics made her an invaluable, albeit prickly, asset. Now, as a member of a secret inner circle, she works to "Set the Shards"—a task she views as the ultimate act of defiance against a father who wanted everything to fade into a single, silent note.

## 📝 Notes
> The "Setting Shard Sanction" - Find a being, bond, object, or place that is centred across the planes broken space. Use methods to send its broken existence in a crazed state. In her experience this has been difficult to do with objects and places and can cause severe damage to them. Once at a point of "Resonance", Use the school or variation of magic that the shard influences in a great  burst of energy. Hypothetically this would cause a chain reaction in the parallel shard, and "Set them across the veil". This has never successfully been done, and they were testing it in the "Brishopric of Bermat", but she has not heard if its been successful yet.
