## 🎭 Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:**
    
    - Ruthlessly efficient, unflinchingly direct, and deeply pragmatic. Vetra is a master of industrial diplomacy — she can negotiate trade deals while calibrating a heat-stressed containment rune.
        
    - Speaks with a deliberate, molten cadence; rarely smiles, but commands respect.
        
- **Flaws & Secrets:**
    
    - Secretly afflicted by an echo-linked condition caused by early exposure to unstable Resonant alloys. She stabilizes herself daily using an arcano-mechanical bracer of her own design.
        
    - Distrusts much of the Ethereal Academy, believing their planar experiments lack the grounded accountability Myzreth must uphold.
        
    - Holds a locked schematic labeled _Project Underspire_, which references an uncompleted Resonance pipeline beneath the Republic.
        
- **What Do They Want?**
    
    - To ensure Begoestia’s survival by keeping its industries stable, contained, and well-funded.
        
    - To push Myzreth’s technological edge forward — but only under her watchful, flame-tempered control.
        

## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Vetra was born in the slag-districts during the early reconstruction period, a child of soot and survival. Apprenticed to the Alloy-Scribes at twelve, she rose through ranks by solving Resonance fractures others feared to touch. Her innovations in stabilizing spell-alloys earned her a reputation as both a genius and a risk.

When the Republic transitioned into formal governance, she was chosen by industrial consensus to represent Myzreth. Her influence helped formalize the Ember Accord, and she remains a bulwark against both magical overreach and populist instability. In the narrative, Vetra can serve as a powerful ally or a political obstacle — depending on whether your goals align with containment or revolution.

## 📝 Notes

- Vetra wears a multi-ringed bracer that constantly tunes her body's Resonant frequency. Tampering with it causes localized planar drift.
    
- Keeps a sealed personal archive titled _Forged for Stability_, containing political blackmail material in case of a coup.
    
- She’s known to vanish into the lower forges during Echo Events — some believe she communes with something below the city.
