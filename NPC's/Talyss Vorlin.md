## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story
> Talyss Vorlin is an enigmatic figure who embodies the strange majesty of Ceal’Tharryn itself. She moves with the easy grace of someone accustomed to altered gravity, often appearing slightly offset from where one would expect her to be, like a figure in a waking dream. Her hair shimmers with a gradient of living greens and blues, mimicking the aurora-like phenomena that sometimes flicker across the city's skies.
> 
> Her eyes—one violet, one gold—are said to perceive the currents of magic directly. Robes stitched with starlight thread billow around her even when there is no wind, and faint motes of crystalline dust follow her passage.
> 
> Though Talyss speaks softly, her presence commands rooms. Her leadership style is pragmatic but visionary; she values innovation, individual brilliance, and delicate political balance between Ceal’Tharryn’s volatile factions.
