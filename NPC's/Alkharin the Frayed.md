## 🎭 Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:**  
    Thoughtful, cryptic, and unfailingly calm. Alkharin speaks in riddles stitched with insight, and often pauses mid-sentence as though listening to a voice no one else hears. He teaches through contradiction and silence, and views linear perception as a limitation. Many find him unsettling, but his knowledge is vast and precise — when he chooses to share it.
    
- **Flaws & Secrets:**
    
    - Alkharin is not fully whole. During a Resonant lapse at the edge of Irslade, his soul was fractured across multiple echo layers. Though stabilized, he now exists in **several reflections simultaneously** — occasionally slipping into discord with himself.
        
    - Each fragment of Alkharin carries slightly different memories and outlooks. While most align harmoniously, a few are known to act independently, and one is believed to have joined the **Council of Echoes**.
        
    - He has written books he does not remember authoring — and destroyed texts he insists he never read.
        
- **What Does He Want?**  
    To map the full topology of the Veil — not just geographically, but emotionally and spiritually. He believes that to understand the Shards is to understand the mind itself, and that healing the world requires us to first **unravel the threads of our own identity**.

## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Alkharin once taught at the Ethereal Academy before vanishing during the **First Planar Echo Storm**. When he reappeared decades later, his mannerisms had changed, and his writings became increasingly nonlinear — diagrams folded into poetry, research that described its own potential erasure.

The Veilbinders took him in after he meditated for three days at the Sanctuary of Threads without food or sleep, humming in tune with the planar pulse. He has since become one of their leading theorists, offering fragmented—but often correct—predictions of Resonance spikes, veil-thinning, and emotional collapse.


## 🔗 Relationships

- **Connected Characters:**
    
    - **[[Mother Revael]]** – Close philosophical companion; their views differ but harmonize like opposing chords.
        
    - Has occasionally advised High Curate [[Nelyra Ves]] during memory-anchoring crises, though he insists he "remembers her differently."
        
- **Enemies/Rivals:**
    - Echo theorists who believe fragmentation is a strength, not a weakness.
    - His own rogue reflection, known only as **The Unraveled**, may be working to collapse the Veil entirely.

## 📝 Notes

- Carries a scroll of **Thread-Notation**, an evolving pattern of script that shifts as the world changes; some believe it is his true memory.
    
- Speaks multiple versions of his own name, depending on the plane or time of day.
    
- Known to hum in silence — those who listen long enough report glimpses of alternate selves or timelines.
  
- His chambers in the Sanctuary of Threads are said to lead somewhere different each time they're entered.
