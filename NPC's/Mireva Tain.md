## üé≠ Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:**
    
    - Brilliant, driven, commanding, and endlessly curious. Mireva is both a visionary and a perfectionist, renowned for her ability to anchor even the most volatile illusions with mathematical precision. She believes illusion is not deception‚Äîit is possibility made manifest.

- **Flaws & Secrets:**
    
    - Her ambition occasionally overrides ethical concerns; she has authorized risky planar experiments that the Governance Committee narrowly halted.
        
    - Mireva believes the Resonance Node is not a source of danger, but of opportunity‚Äîand she secretly seeks to create a stable ‚Äúillusion-plane‚Äù anchored within Velquora.
        
    - Deep down, she resents those who cling to older, slower methods of magical development‚Äîparticularly her former mentor Kein Saldo, whom she considers brilliant but too timid to effect real change.
        
- **What Does She Want?**
    
    - To establish a new paradigm of illusion magic that moves beyond art or entertainment and into reality manipulation on a structural level.
        
    - To unlock the full potential of the Resonance Node and turn Velquora into the first truly cross-planar city‚Äînot just one that touches other realities, but one that lives in many at once.
        

## üìñ Backstory & Role in the Story

Mireva was born in the Mirror District to a family of mirror-crafters, and from a young age, she showed an uncanny ability to perceive‚Äîand alter‚Äîvisual distortions without spellcasting. After being admitted to the Ethereal Academy at just 11, she quickly outpaced her instructors and was taken under the wing of Kein Saldo. Their mentorship was intense but brief; their philosophies quickly diverged, with Mireva favoring aggressive innovation and expansion.

Now the Director of the Academy, Mireva is both a political and arcane force in Velquora. She‚Äôs beloved by younger illusionists for championing progressive theory, and quietly feared by those who question the ethical implications of her work. While her experiments have made astonishing breakthroughs‚Äîsuch as phase-stable illusions and memory-rewriting constructs‚Äîthere is growing concern that her ambitions may one day breach the planar veils in ways that cannot be undone.

In a story, Mireva serves as a powerful ally or antagonist depending on whether the characters seek to preserve Velquora‚Äôs current balance or push its boundaries. She offers knowledge and resources, but her vision always comes at a cost.

## üîó Relationships

- **Connected Characters:**
    
    - Former apprentice of Kein Saldo; their ideological rift defines much of her current direction.
        
    - Fiercely independent and chooses not to maintain formal ties to other NPCs‚Äîshe relies on institutions, not individuals.
        
- **Enemies/Rivals:**
    
    - Faces growing resistance from conservative members of the Academy who fear her influence‚Äîbut she treats them as minor annoyances rather than true threats.
        
- **Factions:**
    
    - Leads the research wing of [[The Ethereal Academy]] with near-complete autonomy.
        
    - Maintains a strained but functional relationship with [[RoB Governance]], whose oversight she often circumvents through technicalities.
        

## üìù Notes

- Mireva wears a shifting cloak that always reflects the version of herself she _wants_ others to see‚Äîcalculated differently for each observer.
    
- She has developed a planar echo simulator beneath the Academy‚Äîunauthorized and hidden‚Äîwhere she tests artificial pocket dimensions.
    
- Her office is rumored to contain a fail-safe illusion, set to erase the entire Academy building from sight should a containment breach ever occur.
