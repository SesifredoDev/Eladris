# DM Tip (Very Important)

Let pirates:

- Swing from rigging
    
- Get shoved overboard
    
- Cut ropes
    
- Panic when leaders fall
    

Morale breaks are your pressure valve. When half are dead, the rest **run**.

---

If you want, I can:

- Turn these into a **rollable pirate encounter table**
    
- Scale them for **lotus-eater / Atlantean variants**
    
- Design **named lieutenants**
    
- Or build a **full ship raid sequence** with objectives
    

Just point me at the next chaos lever 🏴‍☠️🔥
