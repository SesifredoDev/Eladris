## ‚öîÔ∏è Identity & Role

The Inkguard serve as the **enforcing hand of epistemic control**. When knowledge breaches containment, when cities echo themselves, when memory-tampering artifacts go rogue ‚Äî the Inkguard are deployed.

Each Inkguard is not merely trained in battle but also in **resonant logic**, **arcane erasure**, and **memory-stabilization warfare**. Their actions are sanctioned only when the threat of destabilized reality outweighs the cost of suppression.

Their motto is: "We do not protect lives. We protect continuity."

## üßµ Uniform & Marks

- **Inkskin Sigils:** Each Inkguard has phrases or runes scribed into their skin via ink-rune grafting. These marks serve as mnemonic wards, emergency counter-rituals, or memory-seals in the event of Echo exposure.
    
- **Armor:** Blacksteel and vellum-laced laminar, layered with mirror-inscribed plates. Reflections help detect identity bleed or phasic distortion.
    
- **Weapons:** Specialized items include [[Sigilbrand Seals]], silence-bolts, mnemonic daggers, and resonance-cancelling blades known as "Echo Shears."

## üåê Reputation

The Inkguard are **feared**, even among allies. They appear when **truth becomes dangerous**, and leave behind **silence**. Some call them necessary monsters ‚Äî others, the only thing standing between Eladris and a complete echo-collapse.

Despite their terrifying mandate, many Inkguard are deeply principled. They view their duty as **sacrificial**: protecting minds by becoming something less than whole themselves.
