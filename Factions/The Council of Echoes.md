## 🏛️ Basic Info

- **Type:** Transplanar Cabal / Multishard Conspiracy
    
- **Purpose/Mission:**  
    To **manipulate events across multiple Shards simultaneously**, nudging timelines and realities toward an outcome only they seem to understand. The Council believes **singular truth is a cage**, and that existence should be shaped through convergence — where the contradictions of all possible versions are embraced as power.
    
- **Headquarters:** Unknown; members appear in different forms across multiple Shards. Some believe their central gathering space exists in a stabilized Echo fold outside linear time.
    
- **Notable Members:**
    - _"The Unraveled"_ – Possibly a fragment of [[Alkharin the Frayed]]
    - _“Saevra in Reflection”_ – Appears differently to each viewer, always cloaked in mirrored sigils
    - _“The Twin Who Was First”_ – Only seen in overlapping timelines; both child and ancient at once
        
- **Allies/Rivals:**
    - _Allies:_ Whisper-Mongers, radical Echo-aligned artificers, some hidden cults in the Tiseresch fringe
        
    - _Rivals:_ [[The Veilbinders]], [[RoB Governance]] (particularly containment branches), Order of the Still Reflection

## 📖 History

- **Founding Story:**  
    The Council is not believed to have been _founded_ but rather **coalesced**. First mentioned in conflicting texts discovered simultaneously in [[Druvenhal]] and an unrelated ruin in [[Merenvegy]], they are referenced as **those who remember contradictions** — beings who exist not just in broken timelines but because of them.  
    Early theories by Veilbinders suggest the Council formed after the **First Echo Collapse**, when temporal fragments of individuals remained sentient beyond their own deaths.
    
- **Major Conflicts/Involvements:**
    
    - Believed to have seeded false prophecies throughout the Echo Collapse of Quintoria
        
    - Suspected of influencing certain **Shardborn splinter sects**, encouraging anti-linear philosophy
        
    - Accused of infiltrating Begoestian governance records — specifically in the Redscript Division — by inserting policy drafts no one recalls writing
        
    - May have had a hand in the disappearance of several Echo-sensitive archivists from Druvenhal
        
- **Current Status:**  
    The Council is active, though few admit to encountering them directly. Their influence is felt more than seen — in forgotten directives, mirrored dreams, and contradictory personal histories. Some suspect that high-ranking officials or scholars may be Council “echo-forms” without realizing it.

## 🌐 Interaction with the Wider World

### 🧭 In Eladris at Large

The Council of Echoes is viewed with suspicion, awe, or outright fear. Scholars debate their reality; clerics call them heresy. Yet their influence remains undeniable: contradictions in historical records, dual sightings of the same individual, or cities briefly existing in overlapping variations are all attributed to them. Their philosophy — that truth is malleable, and all selves are valid — appeals to fringe Echo theorists, dreamwalkers, and identity-dissolved wanderers.

They are most powerful where the Veil is thin, and in Shards with weak Resonant stabilization. Some see their work as existential sabotage. Others believe they are **preparing the world for something that already happened.**

### 🏛️ In Begoestia

Begoestia views the Council as a **clear metaphysical threat**, particularly within its academic and arcane policy circles.

- **The RoB Governance** has **quietly classified Echo anomalies** believed to be Council-related and actively redacts conflicting historical reports.
    
- Certain factions within the Republic have tried to **recruit counter-philosophers** — mental defense agents trained in identifying and neutralizing “identity drift” associated with Council influence.
    
- Within [[Druvenhal]], the **Archivist Ascendancy** and **Inkguard** actively monitor and contain potential Council references. Some whisper that [[Arch-Lexicon Thariel Vos]] herself once encountered a Council fragment — and lost a piece of herself in the process.
    
- Despite public denouncement, Council rhetoric has subtly infected **free-thinker enclaves**, **Echo-afflicted districts**, and **renegade arcanists** frustrated by the Republic’s control of sanctioned truth.
