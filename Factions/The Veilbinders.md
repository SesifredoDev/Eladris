## 🏛️ Basic Info

- **Type:** Trans-Shard Order of Monks, Arcanists, and Philosophers
    
- **Purpose/Mission:**  
    The Veilbinders seek to **stabilize the Shards of Eladris** and eventually restore the world to its pre-Sundering form. They believe that the Veil — the magical barrier separating Shards and realities — must be mended rather than manipulated. They promote balance between Resonant forces and are opposed to reckless planar interference.
    
- **Headquarters:** [[Sanctuary of Threads]] — a floating temple-fortress hidden between shardlayers, only visible during planar alignments.
    
- **Notable Members:** [[Alkharin the Frayed]], [[Mother Revael]], [[Lyri of the Woven Path]]
    
- **Allies/Rivals:**
    
    - _Allies:_ [[Circle of the Veil]], certain enclaves of the Centreg
        
    - _Rivals:_ [[The Cult of the Final Frequency]], radical elements of the [[The Ethereal Academy]]

## 📖 History

- **Founding Story:**  
    The Veilbinders emerged during the immediate aftermath of the **Sundering Veil**, as small enclaves of planar scholars, monks, and spiritbinders gathered to understand the Shattering and prevent further destabilization. Many of the founding members had witnessed first-hand the horrors of reality collapse and dedicated themselves to the restoration of unity.
    
- **Major Conflicts/Involvements:**
    
    - Disrupted a Cult of the Final Frequency ritual that nearly collapsed the Veil over the city of [[Druvenhal]]
        
    - Successfully stabilized a Resonance Node in the outskirts of [[Merenvegy]], preventing an entire district from folding into Irslade
        
    - Frequently intervene during **Echo Events** where cross-planar bleed threatens populated areas
        
- **Current Status:**  
    Respected by some, dismissed by others as deluded idealists. Veilbinders operate in nearly every major Shard, working in quiet observance, assisting during crises, and guiding communities toward planar awareness. Many governments tolerate them, though some fear their hidden influence.
