## 📚 Philosophy

> “Truth is not democratic. It is dangerous. It must be restrained, or it will unravel everything.”

The Ascendancy holds that **knowledge is the most volatile force left in Eladris**. With the Veil thinning and history itself fracturing, understanding must be actively _curated_, not discovered freely. They advocate for a disciplined, empirical framework for determining what knowledge is:

- **Safe** (to be shared),
    
- **Volatile** (to be restricted), or
    
- **World-breaking** (to be sealed or destroyed).
    

They classify truth by **resonant impact**, **echo instability**, and **identity distortion potential**.

## 🏙️ Structure & Roles

### 🔹 Arch-Lexicon

The supreme arbiter of truth within the Ascendancy. Oversees all classification decisions and has final say over Veil-affecting discoveries.

### 🔹 The Conclave of Indexers

Senior archivists who specialize in philosophical, arcane, and emotional resonance impacts. They debate the implications of newly uncovered truths.

### 🔹 Redscript Engineers

Technicians and glyph-scribes who create memory seals, echo dampeners, and textual quarantines.

### 🔹 Echo Auditors

Field agents trained to investigate phenomena, witness reality instability, and determine truth classification.

### 🔹 Inkguard

The militarized branch. Though technically separate, they enforce Ascendancy protocols in the field and protect high-risk records.

## 📖 Methods & Protocols

- **Mirror-Sealing:** A process by which dangerous memories are stored in reflective containment runes.
    
- **Chrono-Loop Mapping:** Charting timelines that have begun to Echo or diverge within living memory.
    
- **Redacted Containment:** Complete cognitive removal of dangerous knowledge from populations.
    
- **Echo-Silent Classification:** Truths deemed too unstable for verbal or written form — communicated only through sanctioned resonance pulses.

## 🕰️ History & Influence

Formed after the Sundering as a survival mechanism during the Echo Panic. The early Ascendancy grew from monastic libraries and ruined knowledge towers that witnessed entire cities forget themselves. Over time, they consolidated control over what remained of true history, creating a **hierarchy of memory** that shaped RoB policy.

Though not overtly political, their influence over what is considered _true_ gives them power exceeding most councils.

## 🌐 Relations with Other Factions

- **The Veilbinders:** Ideological allies in theory, though friction arises. Veilbinders believe in restoration through empathy and perception. The Ascendancy sees that as dangerously naive.
    
- **The Cult of the Final Frequency:** Mortal enemies. The Cult’s philosophy that all selves should merge into resonance is antithetical to the Ascendancy’s curation of discrete, stable identities.
    
- **Council of Echoes:** Officially classified as myth — but secret records suggest active containment attempts. Some fragments have tried to infiltrate Ascendancy ranks.
