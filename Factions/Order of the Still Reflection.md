## üìñ History

- **Founding Story:**  
    The Order was born in the aftermath of the Sundering Veil, as survivors of the event began losing more than land and magic ‚Äî they began losing themselves. A group of meditative spellhealers, displaced mindweavers, and peace-seeking arcanists gathered in the quiet Resonant fold of Caldrith Vale, swearing to create a place where the _self_ could be repaired. They took inspiration from the natural stillness of the valley and the reflective properties of its Echo pools. Thus began the Order of the Still Reflection.
    
- **Major Conflicts/Involvements:**
    
    - Played a vital role in **The Hollowing**, stabilizing the minds of residents who were temporally inverted during an attempted Resonant exploitation
        
    - Aided the Veilbinders during the **Echo Collapse of Quintoria**, offering sanctuary to those whose identities began to disintegrate
        
    - Successfully lobbied the RoB Governance for legal recognition of ‚ÄúEcho Trauma‚Äù as a protected condition, reshaping post-crisis healing laws across Begoestia
        
- **Current Status:**  
    Active, highly respected, and regarded as spiritually neutral. While the Order does not engage in politics, it is widely consulted on matters of memory, identity, mental reconstruction, and ethical use of reflective magic. The Order is composed of dream-healers, mnemonic guardians, and ritual monks trained in the art of stillness ‚Äî both magical and emotional.
