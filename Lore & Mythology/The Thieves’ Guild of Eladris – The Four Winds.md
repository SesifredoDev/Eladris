_"The honest man measures his life by coin. The guild measures it by direction."_

In shattered Eladris, the thieves’ guild is not a single unified syndicate but a **fractured collection of networks** loosely aligned under the cryptic banner of the **Four Winds**. Each "Wind" represents a cardinal direction, with guildmasters maintaining dominance in their regional spheres. Unlike the nations and states, which have clear borders, the guild’s territory overlaps and bends with smuggling lines, secret routes through Resonance-warped lands, and black markets hidden in both Eladris and Irslade crossings.

Despite this broad identity, the thieves’ guild is plagued with **minor discourse and constant bickering**. Each Wind believes their methods, traditions, and codes are superior, and while assassinations between branches are technically forbidden, rivalries manifest in stolen contracts, undercut trade routes, and quiet betrayals.

## 🌬️ The Four Winds Structure

- **Northwind** – Cold, calculating smugglers and survivalists who dominate in Herwol, Drestr, and the tundra routes. They prize endurance and silence.
    
- **Eastwind** – Masters of illusion, forgery, and subtle poisons operating across Thorinthia, Pebopetsia, and the Tiseresch Empire. Known for decadent courts and infiltration.
    
- **Southwind** – Pact-dealers, caravaneers, and "sand-brokers" thriving in Cabuero, the Mosan Diarchy, and Virterra. They mix theft with contract law and mercantile trickery.
    
- **Westwind** – Raiders and sea-thieves from Reterra, Quintoria, and Begoestia. They are loud, flamboyant, and notorious for smuggling Echo-artifacts via coastal illusion ships.
    

The Winds quarrel constantly about leadership, profits, and what their ultimate purpose should be. Yet when one Wind grows too bold, the others band together to cut it down — a balance of power that has preserved the guild for centuries.

The guild has **no official presence in Drael’Korh, the Iron Grave**.

## ⚖️ Internal Disputes – The Winds at Odds

- **West vs. East**: Westwinds believe in open raiding and loud terror, while Eastwinds prefer subtlety, poison, and forgery.
    
- **North vs. South**: Northwinds claim honor in survival, while Southwinds sneer that contracts and coin matter more than pride.
    
- **Drawfen’s Ledger**: His refusal to embrace the romantic titles of the Winds offends other guilds, but his monopoly on Resonance-stones ensures they tolerate him… for now.
