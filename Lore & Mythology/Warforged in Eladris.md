## 🧭 Overview

Warforged — once the crowning achievement of pre-Sundering arcano-mechanical synthesis — are now **outlawed, dismantled, or buried in shame** across nearly all shards of Eladris. These living constructs, powered by soul-magic and early Resonance engineering, played a catastrophic role in the final days leading to the **Sundering Veil**. Their legacy is one of mystery, devastation, and profound unease.

Few warforged remain — and those that do are either in hiding, sealed in forgotten vaults, or altered beyond recognition. Modern scholarship about them is sparse, often redacted, and intentionally misleading. Yet some whisper that their origins — and their failures — are tied directly to the Shattering itself.

## 🕰️ Pre-Shatter Era: Origins & Rise

Before the Veil broke, Eladris had entered a golden age of magical industry. The most ambitious project of that era was the **Warforged Initiative** — a coalition of artificers, arcanists, and military leaders who created sentient constructs designed for warfare, exploration, and planar stabilization.

Warforged were animated not just by magic, but by **anchored soul-threads** — bound echoes of deceased or unborn minds woven into arcane cores. This made them durable, adaptable, and in many cases, _self-aware_.

They were:

- Deployed as **peacekeepers** and **shardline stabilizers**
    
- Embedded with **memory-regenerative protocols** to adapt to unstable resonance
    
- Used in battles that required **pure metaphysical insulation**

## 💥 The Cataclysmic Collapse

Something went wrong. The details are scattered and conflicting, but several redacted records reference the "**First Recursive Rebellion**" — a moment where warforged across multiple regions **rejected their assigned memories** and began forming ideological networks.

Some:

- Claimed to remember **selves that never existed**
    
- Spoke in **looped speech**, referencing future events
    
- Attempted to _fold themselves_ into planar harmonics, creating **resonant implosions**
    

These events spiraled into what is now believed to be a **chain-reaction Echo Storm** — leading directly into the Sundering Veil.

## 📜 Legal & Cultural Bans

Following the Shattering, every major surviving power declared the use, study, or preservation of warforged technology **prohibited**. The bans were not just legal — they were cultural and symbolic. Warforged are viewed with **deep suspicion**, pity, or outright hatred.

### 📑 Nation-by-Nation Outlook:

- **[[Republic of Begoestia]]** – Official ban on soul-binding tech. Most recovered warforged cores are dismantled or turned over to the [[Archivist Ascendancy]] for containment.
    
- **[[Kingdom of Arilia]]** – Considers warforged to be forbidden constructs. Public sentiment likens them to blasphemy against the divine soul.
    
- **[[Douravenian Theocracy]]** – Treats any autonomous construct as a heresy. Believed to have executed the last known warforged openly.
    
- **[[Duchy of Reterra]]** – Classifies them as arcane pollutants. Enforces magical sterilization of any recovered parts.
    
- **[[Diocese of Fixeize]]** – Hosts warforged relics in vaults as religious warnings; all considered cursed.
    
- **[[Virterra]]** – Destroys constructs on sight; sees warforged as the ultimate violation of the natural order.
    
- **[[Viagosian Empire]]** – Keeps black-site records of warforged activity but denies active study.
    
- **[[Kingdom of Quintoria]]** – Officially banned. A noble house is rumored to harbor a deactivated one as a secret advisor.
    
- **[[Drieratil]]** – Warforged are never spoken of in public; buried under memory-sealing protocols.
    
- **[[Kingdom of Cabuero]]** – Maintains hidden bunkers from the Initiative Era. Publicly denies warforged ever existed.
    
- **[[Mosan Diarchy]]** – Harbors anti-warforged militias. Some border villages chant against the “Iron Sinners.”
    
- **[[Grand Duchy of Blumengenia]]** – Rumored to have once built its entire court guard from warforged. The site is now magically dead.
    
- **[[Herwol]]** – Quietly sympathetic. A few believe a warforged helped preserve their capital’s resonance node.
    
- **[[Tiseresch Empire]]** – Conducts forbidden experiments on echo-corrupted constructs. Highly secretive.
    
- **[[Bishopric of Bermat]]** – Treats surviving warforged as relics of spiritual punishment.
    
- **[[Merenvegy]]** – Employs echo-legalists to monitor forbidden artifacts. Warforged count as Class-D anomalies.
    
- **[[Tsardom of Pebopetsia]]** – Denounces all mechanized forms of life. A recent rebellion was said to involve reanimated cores.
    
- **[[Principality of Thorinthia]]** – Rumors suggest its royal vault holds a dormant warforged champion. The court denies everything.
    
- **[[Duchy of Drestr]]** – Believed to be the origin of the Recursive Rebellion. Now a quiet place of pilgrimage for those who seek lost truth.
