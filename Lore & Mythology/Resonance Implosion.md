## 🏛️ Overview

- **Type:** Cataclysmic Magical Event / Historical Phenomenon
    
- **Origin:** Widely recorded across Eladris, first named by scholars in [[Republic of Begoestia]] after the fall of the Veil in Cael'Tharryn's outer district

## 📖 The Story

> A Resonance Implosion occurs when layered magical frequencies, emotional residues, and ambient Echoes collapse inward upon a single unstable node — a metaphysical vacuum forming from contradictory harmonics, sealed memory constructs, or over-stressed planar threads. Unlike a planar rupture or Echo-fold, an Implosion does not break reality outward, but _devours_ it inwards.
> 
> The effect is not simply physical destruction. Instead, time fragments, memory distorts, and space folds inward as if recoiling from its own past. Victims caught near the epicenter often become locked in recursive loops, forgotten by nearby minds, or reabsorbed into the metaphysical weave with altered identities. Cities have vanished into themselves. Stories, once known, now survive only in emotionally-charged places, like paintings that weep or songs that forget their lyrics.

The largest known Resonance Implosion is believed to have catalyzed the sealing of the **Vault of Deyrun's Fault**, and may be linked to the current instability around the **Spiral Choir’s tone seams**.

## 🔥 Influence on the World

- **How Do People Interpret It?**
    
    - Scholars in Begoestia view it as the natural endpoint of unchecked Echo-manipulation.
        
    - The [[The Veilbinders]] see it as a metaphysical fever: a symptom, not a disease.
        
    - The [[The Cult of the Final Frequency]] believes the Implosions are failed births of the "Final Tone" — that the world is trying to sing itself correctly.
        
    - Douravenian monks conduct silence-rites in known Implosion zones to prevent emotional resonance from reactivating fragments.
        
- **How Does It Affect Society, Religion, or Magic?**
    
    - Areas near past Implosions are considered cursed, yet sacred.
        
    - Certain Echo-mages specialize in identifying unstable harmonic fields to prevent new Implosions.
        
    - Implosion sites are used as testing grounds by the [[The Council of Echoes]], often disguised as memory-fault research zones.
