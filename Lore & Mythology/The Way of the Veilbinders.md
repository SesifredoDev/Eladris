## 📖 The Story

The Veilbinders believe that Eladris was once a unified, harmonic plane — a world where all magic flowed freely and naturally, without distortion. The **Sundering Veil** fractured not only the land but the spiritual and magical unity of the world. The Veilbinders teach that the Veil — the membrane between Shards and realities — is wounded and must be healed.

Their sacred texts describe the world as a great tapestry, each Shard a torn thread. Every Echo Event, every Resonant storm, every planar collapse is a symptom of the wound widening. Through meditation, subtle magic, and the use of ancient binding techniques, the Veilbinders aim to reconnect the Shards, stitch by stitch, and bring the True Eladris back into being.

## 🔥 Influence on the World

- **How Do People Interpret It?**  
    To common folk, Veilbinder teachings are either comforting or terrifying. Some see them as protectors, quietly resolving terrifying anomalies. Others regard them with suspicion — as esoteric cultists who speak in riddles and interfere with things no mortal should touch.
    
- **How Does It Affect Society, Religion, or Magic?**  
    The Veilbinders influence schools of planar magic, especially among illusionists and chronomancers. They reject most planar travel and summoning arts, believing such magic accelerates the Veil’s collapse. Their doctrines are taught in secret monasteries and serve as the philosophical bedrock for some lesser-known healing and spirit-stabilization rites.
