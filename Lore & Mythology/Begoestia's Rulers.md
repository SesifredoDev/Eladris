## 🏛️ Overview
- **Type:** Lore
- **Origin:** [[Republic of Begoestia]]

## 📖 The Story
> When the family of Begoestia was put in place, it was not out of divine ruling but a pact. One  with a Wyvern's Enemy. Though some believe this is just a myth, others believe it to be 100% true.
> 
> The "Soulless Wyvern" would search through the lands year after year, for the very essence of individuals who would maintain his ethereal form, and prevent itself from moving to a deeper plane. Years of attempts to ward off the beast was forcing the local peoples  reserves on military to wear thin.
>
> A Night Hag, whose name has been lost to time made a bargain with the rulers of each of the local kingdoms. She presented blood. Her sisters blood.
> "Set this woman as your singular point of power. May her children move through time unmoved in their positions.  Do thus, and the wyvern will be sent to Blood Rift"
> 
> The Queens, Kings, Lords and ladys of the near lands were almost as exhausted as the farmers who allowed them to eat. They agreed.
> 
> The Woman, of human Race was put in power. Her name was taken at once as the clans name once she past.
> 
>Time moved, and millennia had passed. The race of the monarch moved with love matches, but her blood was still flowing through the rulers bones when the shattering happened
>
>Unease broke, as those who believed the story but was made aware that all the planes were disconnected, including the night hags domain. Those who didn't know this, had  to face that their lands were not fairing well. The battle of the Arcane still current, and general bad management of food and land. 
>
>The world changed that day.  It is said that the ruler sensed it and accepted it wisely. Though many choose to believe that it was forced upon them. Gradually the people moved to a republic, typically made of the highest level of intellectual placement within the mystical or practical arts.  Though as it stands, notably "Kein Salido" is a sage, gnome prodigy who learnt through practical existence through the wild lands.
