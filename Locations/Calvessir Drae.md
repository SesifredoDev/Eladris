## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Calvessir was once a celebrated illusionist professor in Druvenhal before being ousted for conducting experiments with “unreal archives” that nearly consumed part of the library. Founding the Inkcloaks, he turned crime into rhetoric, ensuring that every theft was backed by an ironclad “philosophical” argument. His debates aren’t just talk — his words reshape reality, binding thieves to contracts with echoes of law itself.
