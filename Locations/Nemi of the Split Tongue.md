## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Known as _“Nemi of the Split Tongue”_, she carries coded songs and riddles between guildhouses. Raised among illusionists in Velquora, she learned to twist perception until truth itself became subjective. She now guides caravans through shifting shard routes, often misleading pursuers into dead-ends. Rumors suggest she’s been approached by the Cult of the Final Frequency — but no one knows if she said yes, or if she just made the story up.
