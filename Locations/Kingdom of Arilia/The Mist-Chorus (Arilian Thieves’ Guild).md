## 🏙️ Description

The **Mist-Chorus** is the Arilian branch of the thieves’ guild, masquerading as **wandering bardic companies** and travelling minstrels. While other Winds rely on contracts or piracy, the Arilian thieves weave their crimes into _song_. Each performance carries layered meaning: a ballad sung in High Glinwynd might secretly announce a smuggling route opening in Velwythe, while a tavern jig could mark a target for theft or assassination.

The Chorus uses the natural **Whispering Tone** of Arilia as cover — hiding coded messages in the wind-sung resonance. They claim the land itself carries their secrets from cairn to cairn. Their hideouts are **hollow cairns** where echoes carry rehearsed codes, and every member carries an enchanted tuning stone to “catch the chorus” when apart.

Where knights keep lances, the Chorus keep **songblades** — narrow steel tuned with runes that hum when drawn.

## 🕰️ History

- **Founding/Mythology:** Born from exiled knights who turned to song and shadow after breaking sacred oaths in the Rain-War. They re-forged their honor as “voices of the hidden wind.”
    
- **Major Events:**
    
    - **The Lyren Bell Theft** — Mist-Chorus agents were blamed (though never proven) for aiding the Council of Echoes in stealing the Lyren Bell.
        
    - **The Argent Silence** — a purge by Arilian knights, during which many chorus-leaders were executed. Survivors went underground, weaving tighter codes into their songs.
        
- **Current Status:** Feared by nobles yet tolerated in borderlands, where their smuggled goods and forbidden songs often sustain isolated villages.

## 🌟 Key Locations

- **The Hollow Harp (High Glinwynd):** A tavern/theatre with a harp whose missing strings “sing” on their own; the Chorus meets here in coded verse.
    
- **The Twilight Cairns:** Mist-shrouded cairns double as smuggler caches; no two entrances are ever in the same place twice.
    
- **Velwythe’s Broken Stage:** Once a royal amphitheater, now a ruin where the Chorus tests recruits. Spectral audiences judge performances.

## 🗺️ Notes

- Their “guild rank” is determined by song — an initiate may only carry _two verses_ of the Chorus’s hidden hymn, while a guildmaster carries the _whole song_.
    
- To betray the Chorus is to be **“silenced”**: the traitor’s voice stolen in a ritual, leaving them mute forever.
