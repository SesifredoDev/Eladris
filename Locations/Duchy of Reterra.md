## üèûÔ∏è Description

> Reterra is a realm of opulent sails, prism-towers, and reality-split harbors. Its nobles are illusion-duelists, memory-chroniclers, and fleet lords of vessels that traverse **tidal seams** ‚Äî coastal echo-rifts only visible in moonlight or after resonance pulses. The Duchy thrives on prestige, secrecy, and layered glamours. Every noble house maintains a private harbor, a bonded illusionist, and a ship that is also a mask.
> 
> Cities gleam with mirror-stone canals and reflective bridges. Politics is a dance of identity ‚Äî where who you are depends on who is watching, and titles may shift at dawn. The duchy balances between service to the [[Republic of Begoestia]] and subtle rivalry, providing rare Echo-glass in exchange for autonomy.
