## 🏞️ Description

> Nestled in emerald highlands and mist-cloaked glens, Arilia is a realm of wind, stone, and legend. Bladed ridgelines pierce the clouds while ancient cairns pulse softly with residual Veil energy. The land hums with a quiet, persistent resonance, often mistaken for distant singing — the people call it the **Whispering Tone**.
> 
> Arilian culture is deeply bound to wind and memory. Its knights ride pegasi, sky-oxen, and even Echo-gliders in the higher passes. Every house maintains an Echo-altar where ancestral voices are consulted before major decisions. It is a realm of honor, silence, and oaths that _remember themselves._

The capital, **High Glinwynd**, sits atop a cliff-ridge constantly bathed in drifting cloudbanks. From here, the Silver Crown rules — not through command, but through **resonant decree**, spoken once and then echoed from bell towers, wind chimes, and stone horns across the kingdom.

## 🕰️ History

- **Founding/Mythology:** Said to be shaped from the song of the first wind after the Sundering. The First Queen, Caerelyn, rode a storm-serpent from the broken sky and sealed the Veil-wounds in the north with her breath. Her tomb still sings.
    
- **Post-Sundering Events:**
    
    - Survived a resonance quake from the now-vanished **Lyren Bell**, believed to have been stolen by agents from [[The Council of Echoes]]
        
    - Lost several windborne patrols to shifting borders with the [[Viagosian Empire]] during the Rain-War
        
    - Established the **Arilian Accord** with the [[Republic of Begoestia]] — binding certain Echo-passage rights in exchange for sky-silver trade

## 🌟 Key Locations

- **Caerelyn’s Mouth:** A natural cavern where the wind speaks — used to test truthfulness in royal trials
    
- **The Argent Hall:** Keep of the wind-knights; contains sealed resonance mounts and Echo-bound lances
    
- **Velwythe:** A border town caught between Arilian duty and the theological pull of the [[Douravenian Theocracy]]
    
- **The Twilight Cairns:** Mist-shrouded stone structures that hum faintly at dusk; no two are ever in the same place twice
