## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Once a foundry worker, Jorra was caught smuggling stolen plating to resistance fighters. To escape execution, she replaced half her body with experimental warforged frames. She now runs the Inkcloaks’ black-forge in Myzreth, where she melts down stolen contraband and rebuilds it as “new.” Her workshop doubles as an underground bazaar for mercenaries seeking arcane weapons.
