## 🏞️ Description

> Merenvegy is a realm of mist-choked wetlands, vine-draped ziggurats, and memory made flesh. Beneath its stagnant waters and black lotus groves, **Echo-adepts** refine memory into potions, incantations, and living thought-constructs. Power is held by **witch-kings** and alchemical priesthoods, who trade not in gold, but in _refined recollection_ — distilled dreams, fractured regrets, and bottled guilt.
> 
> The society of Merenvegy is fluid and eerie. People wear masks that reflect their soul’s dominant memory. Names are earned through alchemical trial, not birthright. The swamps are alive with echo-swarms, psychic fogs, and creatures born from regret-bound anomalies. Magic here is thick and emotional — drawn from what was forgotten or should never have been remembered.

The ruling bodies — known as **The Veined Court** — conduct governance through memory exchange, binding decisions to ancestral regrets and cautionary echoes. Loyalty is preserved by threading one’s history into the roots of the marsh itself.
