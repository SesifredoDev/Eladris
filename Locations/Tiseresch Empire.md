## üèûÔ∏è Description

> The Tiseresch Empire is a fading colossus ‚Äî once the axis of order and tradition in eastern Eladris, now a land of marble towers cracked by resonance drift and citadels upheld by spectral decree. Though the empire‚Äôs military and commerce have waned, its **necromantic bureaucracy** remains intact: civil officials serve both in life and after, their spirits bound into offices, roles, or harmonic edicts.
> 
> Here, law is sung ‚Äî literally. Imperial decrees are harmonized into memory-echoes and echoed aloud by Spirit-Scribes to retain permanence. Echo-chimes record civic decisions. Entire blocks of Yuegai city are tuned to emit civic memory on command. Ancestor-writ dictates imperial titles, and decisions often require consultation from both the living and the entombed.

Tiseresch culture prizes **continuity and ritual clarity** ‚Äî a structured world upheld by layered memory. It is said that in Zhanzhurin, one can speak to an office more ancient than the city itself.
