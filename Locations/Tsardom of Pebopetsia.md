## 🏞️ Description

> Pebopetsia is a radiant realm of floating towers, painted sky-bridges, and waking dream-palaces — a mystic tsardom ruled by an ancient dynasty of dragon-masked nobles. These nobles do not merely govern land, but also oversee **dream-gates**: shimmering portals of controlled resonance woven through the fabric of sleep and meditative trance.
> 
> The architecture of Pebopetsia drifts on resonance. Cities float on bound ley-lines. Bridges hang between dream-anchored pagodas, and wind chimes mark shifts in astral alignment. **Resonance calligraphy** — a sacred art — is used to shape law, protect memory, and navigate the intricate dreamways that connect both citizens and allies across the world.

The Tsardom’s populace is highly ritualized. Sleep is sacred, and daily life is structured around lucid cycle maintenance and dream-hygiene. Nobles bind their faces with porcelain dragon masks symbolizing ancestral dreams and dynastic purpose. Few have ever seen the Tsar’s true face.

# ⚖️ The Unspoken Truth

While the High Lords earn masks through dragon-slaying,  
it is the Low Lords who:

- Decide which dragonlings are preserved
- Determine which bones are “viable”
- Shape the inner law of each mask
- Control the awakening ritual

Power in Pebopetsia floats… but it is fired in kilns below.
