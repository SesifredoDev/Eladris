## 🏞️ Description

> In Herwol, thieves are not street rogues or decadent cutpurses — they are **sky-walkers**, outcasts, and whisper-smugglers who navigate Echo-blizzards by starlight. They are masters of **silent travel** across the tundra, guiding contraband through frozen ley-routes where even caravans fear to tread. Their symbol is a blackened shard of crystal, worn as a pendant, that glints purple under aurora light.
> 
> They scorn the softness of southern guilds, calling themselves the **“true shadows”**, for they endure frost, silence, and the unblinking stars. Their codes are sung in **frozen hums**, layered in resonance so that only trained ears can parse their meaning.

The Star-Shadow Walkers consider theft a sacred act of **“taking what fate has left unguarded beneath the sky.”** Their guild is as much spiritual as criminal, blending survival, ritual, and smuggling into one.

## 🕰️ History

- **Mythic Origin:** Born from a tribe that once followed a crystalline beast into the storms and never returned — when they reappeared, they walked unseen in the snow, taking only what was “star-forgotten.”
    
- **Key Moments:**
    
    - Perfected **smuggling by star-map**, memorizing the aurora’s shifting constellations as secret routes.
        
    - Survived multiple purges by masquerading as shamans or “dream-guides.”
        
    - Forged an oath to never keep permanent settlements, only “star-dens,” so no ruler could burn them out.

## 🎭 Practices

- **Contraband:** Frozen Echo-memories, black ice crystal shards, star-maps written in resonance runes.
    
- **Methods:**
    
    - _Silent Runs_ — smuggling caravans that leave no trace in the snow.
        
    - _Echo-Blindings_ — scattering resonance static to confuse spirit-seers.
        
    - _Star-Swearing_ — every theft is ritually aligned to a constellation, as if blessed by the aurora.

## 🌟 Key Figures

- **[[Ygrane Frost-Eye]]** – Elder thief, blind but reads auroras by the vibration of snow underfoot. Keeper of the “Black Sky Codex.”
    
- **[[Korrin the Pale Stepper]]** – Star-map runner, famed for vanishing entire caravans into blizzards, only to have them reappear weeks later with every crate intact.
    
- **[[Salla “Three-Names”]]** – Information-broker, said to carry three souls stolen from frozen memory-spires.

## 🔗 Relationships

- **To Other Guilds:** They mock southern guilds as “fat-bellied fire-dwellers.” They have grudging respect for Drieratil (dream thieves) and Drestr (fate-bound thieves).
    
- **To Tribes:** Tribes tolerate them, so long as they do not steal from kin. To outsiders, they are ghost-stories told around frost-fires.
    
- **To Enemies:** The **Cult of the Final Frequency** hunts them as heretics who “warp the true tones of the aurora.”

## 📝 Notes

- Many wear **star-masks** of ice crystal to conceal their faces during rituals.
    
- Believed to carry the **“Frost Ledger”**, a shifting aurora scroll that lists every oath, theft, and betrayal the guild has ever committed.
