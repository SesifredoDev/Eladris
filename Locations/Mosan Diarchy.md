## 🏞️ Description

> The Mosan Diarchy governs not with a singular voice, but in **mirrored duality** — a desert nation ruled by two figures: the **Outer Monarch**, a luminous presence seen in courts and ceremonies, and the **Inner Sovereign**, whose name and form are hidden by law, speaking only through dreams, visions, or encoded scripture. The desert they rule — called the Deysun — is one of silence, vision-halls, and buried resonance threads.
> 
> Architecture here is austere, sculpted from wind-swept glassstone and echo-hollowed stone. Streets reflect starlight in unnaturally straight lines. Every citizen swears fealty to both rulers in mirrored fashion — one oath spoken aloud, one written in sand or shadow.

The land itself is marked by the **Shardwinds** — unpredictable magical gales that carry memory-dust and fragments of voices. The people have adapted, speaking in gestures or layered tones when the wind sings.

A profound mystery surrounds the two rulers themselves: the Diarchs are twin brothers, born under a veiled eclipse. During a resonance storm at their birth, one of the infants was briefly lost to the Veil — making him a **"lost one"** from the moment of his arrival. No record or rite has ever been able to confirm which brother is the lost one, and by sacred law, neither is permitted to acknowledge or investigate this truth. Yet together, they rule with grace and equilibrium, each compensating for the other's silence or speech.

Only one of the brothers has a known heir — a child who will one day inherit the complexities of leaving mirrored rulership.

## 🕰️ History

- **Founding Belief:** The Diarchy began after the Sundering shattered the original monarch. From the broken soul rose two halves: one light-bound, one vision-bound. The first Diarchs forged a unity pact in mirrored ink.
    
- **Key Historical Events:**
    
    - Constructed the Mirror Vault of Kharvun, where the Outer Monarch communes with the hidden ruler's words
        
    - Defended against Shardwind incursion during the Crystalline Cyclone, using harmonic silencing rituals
        
    - Regularly renews the Dual Rite of Dust and Flame, where both rulers bless the land through gesture and dream

## 🌟 Key Locations

- **Deyruhl:** Desert frontier city known for its Echo-traders and mirage-bound markets.
    
- **The Shardwinds Expanse:** A roaming desert force — more phenomenon than place — where time folds and voices repeat.
