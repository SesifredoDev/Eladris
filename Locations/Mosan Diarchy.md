## 🏞️ Description

> The Mosan Diarchy governs not with a singular voice, but in **mirrored duality** — a desert nation ruled by two figures: the **Outer Monarch**, a luminous presence seen in courts and ceremonies, and the **Inner Sovereign**, whose name and form are hidden by law, speaking only through dreams, visions, or encoded scripture. The desert they rule — called the Deysun — is one of silence, vision-halls, and buried resonance threads.
> 
> Architecture here is austere, sculpted from wind-swept glassstone and echo-hollowed stone. Streets reflect starlight in unnaturally straight lines. Every citizen swears fealty to both rulers in mirrored fashion — one oath spoken aloud, one written in sand or shadow.

The land itself is marked by the **Shardwinds** — unpredictable magical gales that carry memory-dust and fragments of voices. The people have adapted, speaking in gestures or layered tones when the wind sings.

## 🕰️ History

- **Founding Belief:** The Diarchy began after the Sundering shattered the original monarch. From the broken soul rose two halves: one light-bound, one vision-bound. The first Diarchs forged a unity pact in mirrored ink.
    
- **Key Historical Events:**
    
    - Constructed the Mirror Vault of Kharvun, where the Outer Monarch communes with the hidden ruler's words
        
    - Defended against Shardwind incursion during the Crystalline Cyclone, using harmonic silencing rituals
        
    - Regularly renews the Dual Rite of Dust and Flame, where both rulers bless the land through gesture and dream

## 🌟 Key Locations

- **Isarret:** Capital of light and sand. Built in concentric circles to reflect dawn and dusk equally.
    
- **Kharvun:** Site of the Mirror Vault; a subterranean temple where vision-echoes are transcribed by flame-scribes.
    
- **Deyruhl:** Desert frontier city known for its Echo-traders and mirage-bound markets.
    
- **The Shardwinds Expanse:** A roaming desert force — more phenomenon than place — where time folds and voices repeat.
