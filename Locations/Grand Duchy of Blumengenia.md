## 🏞️ Description

> The Grand Duchy of Blumengenia floats between waking and dream — a tranquil realm of misted peaks, reflective lakes, and snow-veiled towers where silence is cultivated like wine. Dreams are taken seriously here: not as mere visions, but as **social rituals**, navigable experiences, and sometimes even **shared legal spaces**. Citizens carry etched dream-diaries, consulted by counselors known as **Serenists** to resolve interpersonal tension and interpret civic alignment.
> 
> Blumengenia’s cities are quiet yet opulent. Echo-chimes hang from every structure, tuned to the psychological tone of neighborhoods. Operas are performed not with music alone, but with layered emotion-weaves and echo-augmentation — the performers' dreams projected subtly over the audience.

The Duchy reveres **personal inner worlds** and holds a cultural belief that true law is dream-consented. Thus, all rulership is symbolic — the Grand Duke rarely speaks, but instead conveys policy through curated dream cycles shared with nobility and guilds.
