### 🏙️ Description

**Tessavar Reach** is the wind-scoured frontier of Begoestia — a city strung like a net of steel and spell-thread across the shattered edge of an ice cliff. It hangs over the **Glass Maw**, a bottomless rift where Resonance spirals so violently that sound warps, and sight often fails. The city’s architecture is equal parts miracle and madness: entire districts are suspended from cliff faces by enchanted anchors, levitating platforms drift freely on calibrated magic, and some neighborhoods must be re-stabilized weekly after atmospheric fluctuations.

Known as the “Reach of No Return” to outsiders, Tessavar is a haven for **skyship pilots**, shard-divers, storm-traders, and spellwright engineers who thrive on chaos and cliff-edge living. The air is alive with motion — ships gliding in and out of cloud-split bays, cargo skiffs racing windriders, and suspension lifts ferrying travelers from sector to sector, all dancing to the silent rhythm of Resonant winds.

Despite its precarious geography, Tessavar is fiercely proud and economically vital. Its skyship yards produce the fastest and most daring vessels in Begoestia, and its proximity to raw Shardfall makes it a hotspot for salvage crews and exploratory guilds. It is a city where fortunes are made — and lost — in the time it takes a tether to snap.

### 🕰️ History

- **Founding/Mythology:**  
    Founded by nomadic shard-sailors who settled along the edge of the post-Sundering rift. According to legend, the city began as a single rope bridge between two floating fragments, expanded over generations into a gravity-defying labyrinth. The first guilds were skyfisher families who learned to “read” the Resonant winds and use them for lift.
    
- **Major Events:**
    
    - **The Tether Storm Collapse** – A catastrophic storm that tore loose three sectors from the cliffside. The debris became a drifting colony known as _Lostline_. Survivors now work as shard-guides.
        
    - **The Skyship Uprising** – An insurrection led by free captains against RoB Trade Fleet restrictions. Eventually resolved with a fragile truce, granting sky captains partial independence in exchange for limited governance oversight.
        
    - **The Echo Drift of 78** – A planar distortion pulled part of the southern docks halfway into Irslade for several minutes. The ship _Silver Threnody_ returned altered, crewed by echoes of itself.
        
- **Current Status:**  
    Dangerous but thriving. Tessavar Reach is autonomous in spirit, though technically part of Begoestia’s jurisdiction. Its people are renowned for their nerve, navigational skill, and sharp distrust of anything too grounded.

### 🌟 Key Locations

- **The Skybind Cradle** – Tessavar’s central shipyard, a webbed platform suspended above the abyss where legendary vessels are built and tested against the screaming wind currents.
    
- **Spirewind Market** – A jagged chain of wind-exposed terraces where stormglass, salvaged Echo-ore, and enchanted skyblades are bartered. The market stalls are lashed to the rock; traders are not.
    
- **The Hanging Crown** – A tavern and pilot hall built upside-down into the underside of a floating plateau. Gravity realigns upon entry. The Crown is where contracts are made, crews assembled, and secrets sold.
    
- **Gildreach Anchorage** – An upper-district bastion tethered to the highest cliffs, home to dignitaries, sanctioned RoB observers, and scholars studying the instability of the rift below.
    
- **The Mawfront** – A desolate observation deck and ritual platform at the very edge of the abyss. Used in storm ceremonies, sky-burials, and as a place to say goodbye to those who don’t return.
