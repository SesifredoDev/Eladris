## 🏙️ Description

Ceal’Tharryn is less a city and more a suspended miracle—a broken crown of floating
islands drifting above a storm-wreathed land scar. Gravity is a suggestion here. Some
buildings rise upside-down, others spiral around themselves like notes in an unfinished
melody. Bridges of pure light span the gaps between shattered plazas, and time itself
sometimes skips a beat in the air.
At the center of it all rises the Shardspire, a colossal monolith of obsidian torn apart by
ancient arcane forces. Fractured chunks hover motionless around it, each one
whispering with faint echoes of a realm not quite here, not quite gone. The people who
dwell in Cael’Tharyn are either brilliant or mad—sometimes both. Mages train under
starlight at noon. Astral cartographers chart the drifting isles, which never float the
same path twice.
But for all its majesty, Cael’Tharyn is a place of tension. The weave of magic is frayed,
the air thick with arcane residue. Visitors risk vertigo, memory distortion, or sudden
spells gone awry. Some say that Ceal’Tharryn isn’t just in the sky—it’s slowly becoming
part of another reality entirely.

## 🕰️ History
- **Founding/Mythology:**  
	- When the shattering occurred, shards appeared all over the world dotted seemingly at random. Locals believed the most significant one to appear was the one that obliterated the obsidian Pillar that sat central to there city.
	- Jagged parts of the obelisk shot into the air, and then abruptly held still in mid air. The resulting shape resembles that of a Geometric Flower if viewed from the top down.
	- Since the Shattering the leadership of the country has changed hands and moved its capital here
	- In the last 500 years, a project towards removing themselves from battles wake was taken, and the entire city was levitated in parts into the sky for greater Defensive abilities.
