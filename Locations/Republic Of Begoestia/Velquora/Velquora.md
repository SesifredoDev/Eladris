## üèôÔ∏è Description
> Velquora, the "City of Shifting Echoes," on Begoestia's eastern shore, is a metropolis where illusion isn't just a craft; it's the very fabric of reality. Rooted above a deep Resonance Node, the city pulsates with raw magical energy that doesn't just warp the physical ‚Äì it dances with perception itself. Here, the line between what is real and what is artifice blurs with every passing moment.

Imagine streets that shimmer and subtly rearrange themselves under the moonlight, not through brute magical force, but through intricate layers of illusion woven into the very stones. Buildings might appear to twist and morph, their facades adorned with ephemeral projections that shift and dissolve like dreams. Navigating Velquora is an exercise in trusting your senses, yet knowing they can be playfully, or sometimes deceptively, led astray. What seems like a solid wall might ripple and reveal a hidden passage; a grand avenue could dissolve into a mirage, leading to a tucked-away courtyard that wasn't there moments before.

The inhabitants of Velquora are masters of this illusory landscape. Illusionists don't just perform on stages; their craft is integrated into daily life. Homes might boast ever-changing d√©cor, adapting to the moods of their occupants. Merchants peddle wares that gleam with enchantments that may or may not be entirely genuine, the artistry of the illusion often being as valuable as the object itself. Even the city's defences rely on intricate layers of deception, making it a bewildering fortress to any would-be invaders.

Planar scholars are drawn to Velquora not just for the raw magical energy, but for the thin veils between realities that the Resonance Node occasionally pierces. These fleeting glimpses into other planes often manifest as visual anomalies, shimmering distortions in the air, or echoes of alien landscapes overlaid onto the city. Studying these transient phenomena requires a keen eye and a mind attuned to the subtle nuances of illusion and reality.

Velquora is a city that thrives on the ephemeral, a place where the impossible is commonplace and perception is fluid. To wander its streets is to step into a living dream, a testament to Begoestia's fearless exploration of magic's most subtle and deceptive arts. Just remember, in the City of Shifting Echoes, what you see is rarely all there is, and the greatest wonders often lie just beyond the veil of illusion.

The people of this city are generally of the view that illusions in every nature are the sign of a wise mind. Understanding of the people and how they intuitively feel the world around them, existing in another persons perspective, that is the true meaning of wisdom.

## üï∞Ô∏è History
- **Founding/Mythology:**  
	- The founding of Velquora is shrouded in layers of myth and illusion, much like the city itself. Some tales speak of ancient mages drawn to the potent Resonance Node, seeking to harness its power for their arcane experiments. When they first encountered it, the tale says it was receptible to all kinds of magic, un-aligned to one type of .
	  Others whisper of a planar tear that deposited a fragment of a dreamlike realm onto Begoestia's shore, its ethereal essence solidifying into the city. A popular legend credits a cabal of master illusionists who, in the early days after the Shattering, deliberately shaped the raw magical energies of the Node to create a city that defied conventional reality, a sanctuary for those who understood the art of deception and the malleability of perception. Regardless of the true origin, Velquora has always been intrinsically linked to the unpredictable magic that flows beneath it.
- **Major Events:** 
	- **The Planar Echo Storm:** A rare and dangerous event where the veils between dimensions thinned dramatically above Velquora, resulting in fleeting but tangible incursions from other planes. Residents reported seeing impossible architectures flicker into existence, hearing alien whispers on the wind, and even encountering strange entities that vanished as quickly as they appeared. This event spurred increased interest and research among the city's planar scholars.
	- **The Great Illusionary Exposition:** A grand festival held every few decades, where the most skilled illusionists from across Begoestia and even other shards gather in Velquora to showcase their most breath-taking and intricate creations. The city transforms into a kaleidoscope of impossible sights and sensory deceptions, attracting visitors and bolstering Velquora's reputation as the epicentre of illusory arts.
- **Current Status:** (Prosperous, war-torn, abandoned, etc.)
