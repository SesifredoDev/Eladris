## 🏙️ Description
Begoestia is a republic adrift in the shattered aftermath of the Shattering — a nation where magic bleeds so deeply into the land that reality itself warps under its weight. Here, arcana is not merely practiced; it is lived, breathed, and built into every structure and system.

The land itself hums with Resonance, drawing explorers, scholars, and dreamers alike. Magic permeates daily life: homes float lazily above gardens, artisans weave spells as deftly as thread, and merchants peddle goods enhanced by minor enchantments. Gravity bends in odd ways — what is 'up' and 'down' may shift with a street’s curve — disorienting visitors from more "stable" shards.

Though Begoestia’s relentless pursuit of arcane innovation has drawn criticism and disdain from more conservative nations, its success is undeniable. New devices and enchantments spring forth constantly, automation is again on the rise, and even time seems more suggestion than law within its bounds. Where others see recklessness, Begoestians see evolution.

Magic, however, is not without cost. The land's chaotic nature reflects deeper scars: floating islands drift across skies fractured by Resonance Nodes, and rivers loop into the clouds like silver ribbons. Stray too far, and one might find themselves stepping across realities without warning.

Ceal’Tharryn, Begoestia’s capital, crowns the republic — a breathtaking cluster of floating archipelagos suspended above a raging storm-scar. At its heart stands the Shardspire, a colossal, broken obelisk around which the city whirls. Scholars, mages, artificers, and the curious flock here, seeking to study the endless anomalies spawned by the fractured world. Aristocrats from distant shards — even rival nations — have established grand estates here, drawn by the republic's unparalleled magical prowess and wealth.

Flight is not a luxury but a necessity. Most native species have adapted, growing wings or mastering levitation magic. Even the ceremonial Sov, **Gerecht**, is an Aarakocra — a relic from ancient traditions when leadership was borne by those closest to the skies. Today, the Sov’s title holds more symbolic than political power, a reminder of the old world amid the ever-changing new.

Yet behind the beauty and brilliance lies a warning: the Resonance that empowers Begoestia also frays its stability. Echo Events — ripples of altered reality — are rare but feared, and some whisper that Begoestia is slowly slipping closer to Irslade itself. Here, every miracle teeters on the edge of disaster.
