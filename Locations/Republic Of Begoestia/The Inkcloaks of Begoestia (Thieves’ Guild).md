## 🏙️ Description

> The **Inkcloaks** are thieves, smugglers, and reality-brokers who thrive in Begoestia’s chaotic magic-scape. Unlike common criminals, they present themselves as scholars and philosophers, weaving their heists into the republic’s fabric of invention. Guildhouses appear as debating halls or research collectives — but behind the scrolls and symposiums lie contracts written in **resonance-infused ink** that bind thieves as tightly as any magical oath.
> 
> They specialize in **illegal arcane inventions** — smuggling unstable resonance-tech, binding fragments of Echo Events, and forging reality-bending devices that even Begoestia’s government refuses to sanction. Their creed is that invention should never bow to law, only to brilliance.

They’re both admired and feared — some see them as patrons of genius, others as reckless traffickers who could unravel the republic itself.

## 🕰️ History

- **Origin Myth:** Formed after the Warforge, when outlaw artificers refused to disarm. They cloaked their dealings in “debates,” disguising their guild as intellectual societies.
    
- **Major Moments:**
    
    - Built the first **phantom archives** — libraries that exist partially outside time, used for smuggling stolen texts.
        
    - Almost dismantled by Centreg infiltration, but turned the spies into double-agents by rewriting their memories.
        
	    - Played a covert role in stabilizing Velquora after a Resonance collapse — for a fee, of course.

## 🎭 Practices

- **Contraband:** Prototype warforged frames, fractured crystals, reality-bending “inkweaves,” illegal spell-grafts.
    
- **Methods:**
    
    - _Inkbinding_ — contracts written in enchanted ink that burn into the skin if broken.
        
    - _Resonance Recasting_ — altering magical items mid-transport so they pass through inspections as harmless objects.
        
    - _Debate Duels_ — ritualized arguments where the winner earns the right to claim a mark or contract.

## 🌟 Key Figures

- **[[Calvessir Drae]]** — Master “Inkphilosopher,” elf illusionist who hosts the grandest debates in Ceal’Tharryn; said to settle every theft with a flourish of quill.
    
- **[[Jorra Mynt]]** — Half-golem fence, her body half-rebuilt with prototype warforged plating. Runs Myzreth’s black-forges.
    
- **[[Nemi of the Split Tongue]]** — Tiefling courier who speaks in double-meanings, guiding caravans through shifting shard routes with “two truths and one lie.”

## 🔗 Relationships

- **To Other Guilds:** Distrusted by Herwol’s Star-Shadow Walkers (seen as decadent), but highly courted by Quintoria (warforged contraband trade).
    
- **To Government:** The Centreg watches them constantly, but many officials are already inkbound by contract.
    
- **To Enemies:** Begoestian moralists and traditionalist sects accuse them of dragging the Republic closer to disaster.

## 📝 Notes

- They tattoo contracts across their skin, hiding smuggling routes in shifting script only visible under aurora-light.
    
- Their symbol: a **black feather quill dripping resonance ink**.
