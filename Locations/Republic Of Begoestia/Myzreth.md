### 🏙️ Description

**Myzreth** is the hammerfall heart of Begoestia’s arcane industry — a city where fire meets formula, and molten metal is infused with magic at the moment of its forging. Carved into the jagged walls of a collapsed shard-crater, the city rises from heat-slick stone and steam-plumed furnaces, framed by glowing ley-pipes and floating smelteries.

The skyline is marked by arcano-industrial wonders and smoke-belching spell-forges. Above it all looms the **Brass Assembly Tower**, where High Forge-Councillor **Vetra Korran**, Myzreth’s appointed representative in the Republic’s governance, oversees production quotas, Resonance regulation, and military-grade enchantment policies. Korran is both feared and respected — a bureaucrat forged in the crucible of molten politics.

Despite Myzreth’s chaos, the city’s infrastructure is tightly regulated. Arcane inspectors called _Fume Sentinels_ patrol spell-forges and transport lifts, enforcing laws written in both ink and flame. Yet beneath the industry lies a pulse of unpredictable magic — a reminder that all progress here walks a razor’s edge.

## 🕰️ History

- **Founding/Mythology:**  
    Myzreth rose from the wreckage of a battlefield where Warforge once turned the world to ash. In the aftermath of the Shattering, it was rebuilt not as a monument to destruction, but as a forge for reinvention. Early artificers believed that by reclaiming the ruined land and binding magic to industry, they could shape a future stronger than any war could shatter.
    
- **Major Events:**
    
    - **The Ember Accord:** An agreement formed after a string of magical reactor failures nearly sank half the city into a Resonant Sinkhole. The Accord forced a standardized system of enchantment safety protocols, now enforced by arcane inspectors known as _Fume Sentinels_.
        
    - **The Black Tithe:** A month-long period where unstable planar interference caused dozens of failed constructs to animate and riot through the districts. Containment succeeded, but scars remain. The district where it began is now called _Ashspan_.
        
- **Current Status:**  
    Myzreth is booming, both economically and magically. Its exports of arcane alloys and industrial enchantments fund much of Begoestia’s infrastructure and airship fleets. But its growth sits atop a magma vent of danger — both literal and planar. One misplaced experiment could rupture the entire city's precarious equilibrium.

## 🌟 Key Locations

- **Ashspan District**  
    Once a thriving forge sector, now a partially quarantined ruin following the catastrophic _Black Tithe_. Rogue magic lingers in the rubble, occasionally animating constructs or echoing past events. Salvagers and radicals are known to prowl its borders despite Fume Sentinel patrols.
    
- **The Emberstride Warrens**  
    A vast, shifting underground market where forbidden enchantments, reclaimed shard-tech, and unstable prototype parts are traded. The layout subtly changes after Echo Events, making some stalls accessible only during specific Resonant cycles.
    
- **Fumehold Terrace**  
    A dense, working-class district housing forge-workers and mid-level artificers. Its steam-slick towers and radiant lattice homes hum with regulated arcane flow. Community-run guild halls control access to tools, housing, and apprentice trials.
    
- **Brass Assembly Tower**  
    The political and administrative center of Myzreth. Home to **Vetra Korran**, the tower is a bastion of arcano-bureaucratic control, where industrial policy, Accord enforcement, and Resonance containment strategies are debated and enforced.
    
- **Skytether Anchorage**  
    A floating dock complex where airships deliver ore, salvage, and volatile goods. Stabilized by massive enchanted chains and weather wards, the Anchorage is vital to Myzreth’s trade—yet always at risk from pirates and Echo turbulence.
    
- **Forgeheart Core**  
    A superheated chamber deep within the city, where Resonant magma and storm-energy are refined into arcane power. Access is restricted, and anomalies are routine. It is both Myzreth’s energy source and a symbol of its arcano-industrial ambition.
