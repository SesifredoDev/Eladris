## üèôÔ∏è Description

> The Spiral Choir is not a city in the traditional sense. It is a **drifting structure**, a warped fusion of planar detritus, broken skyship hulls, resonant crystal spires, and bone-metal latticework, all coiled around a slowly rotating fragment of dead Veinstone. The entire structure hums ‚Äî not with machinery, but with the Cult's endless **chanting harmonics**, which echo across the void and pull nearby resonance thin.
> 
> From the outside, it appears as a spiraled gyre of fractured architecture slowly folding and unfolding itself, like a blooming resonance wound. Internally, gravity is subjective, architecture is recursive, and space is altered by tone. One may walk in spirals and find they‚Äôve returned to a place not physically possible.

## üï∞Ô∏è History

- **Founding/Mythology:** Said to have coalesced rather than been built. Cult records suggest The Spiral Choir appeared after the first successful attempt to channel the Final Frequency ‚Äî forming itself around the survivors of a failed resonance collapse ritual.
    
- **Major Events:**
    
    - Birthplace of the first confirmed [[Vessel of Collapse]]
        
    - Where [[Serith of the Folded Voice]] first began her reverse-tonal sermons
        
    - Responsible for the "Disintegration of Istavan Ridge," an event that turned a border shard into crystalline salt over the course of one chanting week
        
- **Current Status:** Active. Believed to currently hover near the Folded Shardline. Tracked remotely by RoB Governance Resonance Watch, but impossible to intercept due to irregular visibility.

## üåü Key Locations

- **The Harmonic Core:** The central spiral chamber where ritual resonance is built and sustained. Home to a constantly shifting tone that affects thoughts and memory.
    
- **The Dissonant Choir-Halls:** Where the Cult gathers to chant; acolytes chant not in unison, but in guided chaos, each seeking to shape the Tone toward collapse.
    
- **Vault of Refracted Selves:** A chamber of mirrors and memories. Used to unbind identity and prepare members for their role as Frequencies  or [[Vessels of Collapse]].
    
- **The Ravel Halls:** Private meditation and exposure chambers filled with Veil-thin echoes. Frequently used for ritual ‚ÄúBaptisms.‚Äù
    
- **The Shardbridge:** An external deck grown from crystal struts and rusted alloy, used for external rituals and Echo-summoning rites. Those who walk it are rarely the same when they return.
