## üèûÔ∏è Description

> The Bishopric of Bermat is a realm of relics, silence, and sanctified memory ‚Äî a sacred polity where rulers descend from saint-blood lines and where history itself is curated like scripture. Built upon layers of ossified faith, Bermat weaves religion and record-keeping into a single practice: every bishop is both a spiritual guide and a memory-archivist, charged with interpreting inherited memory through Echo-reading.
> 
> Its cities are carved from relic-stone, with ossuaries doubling as administrative archives. The most important texts are etched into bone, wrapped in vellum, and stored beside the relics of canonized rulers. Political authority flows from the **Chorus Ecclesia**, a council of relic-kings and saint-descended clerics who must reach harmonic consensus to enact new doctrines.

Temples here are often silent, filled with faint resonance tones rather than voices. Worshipers meditate among relics and whisper Echo-prayers through incense-laced masks.

## üï∞Ô∏è History

- **Founding Belief:** Bermat claims lineage from Saint Erythia, who drank the first holy echo from a broken bell during the Sundering and preserved her mind as a liturgical waveform.
    
- **Key Historical Events:**
    
    - Orchestrated the **Canon Reckoning**, a centuries-long purification of false relics and echo-frauds
        
    - Fought the **Echo-Census War** with the [[Tiseresch Empire]] over soul-tracking and memory ownership
        
    - Initiated the **Ossuary Concord** to formalize international relic-trade and harmonize religious echo-signatures
