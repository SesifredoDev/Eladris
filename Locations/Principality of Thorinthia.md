## 🏞️ Description

> The Principality of Thorinthia is a realm of veils, performance, and layered politics — a coastal crescent of masked courts, mirrored harbors, and desire-bound rites. Ruled by a line of **passion-princes and masked consorts**, Thorinthia’s nobility thrives on spectacle, secrecy, and the subtle art of Echo-tempered emotion. Few speak plainly here; intentions ripple beneath curated identity and illusion.
> 
> Cities glimmer with candlelight illusions, echo-mirage façades, and tower gardens that bloom based on nearby emotional resonance. The court conducts diplomacy through dance, scent-language, and poetic duel — truth is performed, not declared. Memory is currency in noble circles, with entire estates built upon shared recollection rights and curated pasts.

The principality’s coastal Echoes are said to carry voices of old loves and unshed tears. Its influence lies not in force, but in the orchestration of perception — diplomacy through enchantment and memory weaving.
