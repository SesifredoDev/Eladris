## 📍 Guild Overview

- **Base of Operations:** Secret chambers within abandoned archive wings, crypt-libraries, and spectral offices where spirit-bound clerks continue their work.

## 👤 **Guildmaster – Selvarin Churek**

- **Appearance:** Draped in dark robes etched with faded harmonic glyphs; eyes often hidden behind ink-sealed monocles.
    
- **Personality:** Cold, precise, and obsessed with hierarchies; views bureaucracy itself as a weapon.
    
- **Rumors:** Supposedly controls a ledger linking every civil spirit in the empire to clandestine guild networks — able to summon bureaucratic “phantoms” to enforce or manipulate contracts.

The **Grave Ledger** thrives by turning the Tiseresch Empire’s obsession with necro-bureaucracy into a tool for theft and manipulation. In a land where even the dead work, the guild moves unseen, striking at law, memory, and contract alike.
