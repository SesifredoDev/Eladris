## 🏞️ Description

> The Tiseresch Empire is a fading colossus — once the axis of order and tradition in eastern Eladris, now a land of marble towers cracked by resonance drift and citadels upheld by spectral decree. Though the empire’s military and commerce have waned, its **necromantic bureaucracy** remains intact: civil officials serve both in life and after, their spirits bound into offices, roles, or harmonic edicts.
> 
> Here, law is sung — literally. Imperial decrees are harmonized into memory-echoes and echoed aloud by Spirit-Scribes to retain permanence. Echo-chimes record civic decisions. Entire blocks of Yuegai city are tuned to emit civic memory on command. Ancestor-writ dictates imperial titles, and decisions often require consultation from both the living and the entombed.

Tiseresch culture prizes **continuity and ritual clarity** — a structured world upheld by layered memory. It is said that in Zhanzhurin, one can speak to an office more ancient than the city itself.

## 🕰️ History

- **Foundation Myth:** Founded by Huáng Tien, who bound his own soul to the first imperial codex to stabilize the law through the Sundering. His voice still speaks when new laws are harmonized.
    
- **Key Historical Events:**
    
    - Lost major territory during the Veilshift Collapse, but retained control through harmonic rites
        
    - Developed the **Soul-Lattice Census**, tracking every soul in the empire — living or not
        
    - Brokered a ritual-stasis truce with [[Bishopric of Bermat]] to end the Echo-Census War
