## 📍 Guild Overview

- **Base of Operations:** Hidden in abandoned or unstable tunnels, echo-refinement chambers, and collapsed forges. Many lairs are **vertical networks**, accessible only via rope, lifts, or memory-guided pathways.
    
- **Cover Identity:** Members pose as **tunnel-foragers, echo-harvest apprentices, or trade-assistants**. Outsiders assume they are simple miners or low-level forgers.
    
- **Specialties:**
    
    - Stealing high-value resonance metals, memory-stone, and pre-Sundering relic fragments
        
    - Smuggling refined Echo-metals and vision-glass to outside buyers without leaving traceable pulse-residues
        
    - Exploiting natural time distortions in deep tunnels to vanish or reappear undetected
        
    - Black-market contracts for rare pulse-forges and unstable Echo-lodes

## 👤 **Guildmaster – Drawfen “Stonehand” Vaeril**

- **Appearance:** Cloak lined with thin, reinforced daggers; fingernails tipped for prying or marking tunnels. Often carries a tool-lantern that doubles as a concealed weapon.
    
- **Personality:** Calculating and rigid; treats tunnels as chessboards, echo currents as moves. Obsessed with maintaining loyalty and precision.
    
- **Rumors:** Can navigate the deepest resonance mines blindfolded, recovering items thought lost in unstable zones. Some say he has mapped the entire underlands in memory alone.

## 🏚️ Guild Lair

- **The Hollow Loom (Ulnmark):** The main lair, concealed within a resonance-root chamber. Shifting runes act as both wards and markers; uninitiated intruders are trapped in echo-loops.
    
- **Delthold Sublevels:** Trade-hub disguised as standard forges. Smuggling corridors are tunneled behind glowstone walls.
    
- **Gravenreach Vaults:** Dangerous, high-security sites for storing stolen Echo-metals and vision-glass. Only trusted members enter, and even then, under pulse-safety protocols.
