## 📍 Guild Overview

- **Base of Operations:** Hidden within the **canopies of Virelin** and the drifting stone-lilies of Koralhame. Entrances are disguised as hollowed trees, camouflaged grottos, or shifting mounds of moss.
    
- **Cover Identity:** Members are known as **Bonded Foragers** — gatherers of rare herbs, dream-beasts, and spirit-tokens. Outsiders assume they are druids, healers, or spirit-speakers.
    
- **Specialties:**
    
    - Stealing illicit goods from outsiders while preserving ecological balance
        
    - Smuggling exotic or spiritual contraband, often living creatures or plant spirits
        
    - “Spirit debts” — extorting or negotiating with merchants through mystical leverage rather than violence
        
    - Protecting the secrets of the Shard-wilds and disrupting incursions from nations like Cabuero or Viagosia

## 👤 **Guildmaster – Elowen “Roothand” Varis**

- **Appearance:** Wears living bark and moss inlaid into clothing; vines coil around arms as subtle armor. Fingernails capped with small obsidian talons for climbing and stealth.
    
- **Personality:** Calm, patient, and deeply attuned to the land. Uses the forest itself as a tool for discipline, communication, and surveillance.
    
- **Rumors:** Some claim Elowen can whisper commands to the trees themselves, making forest paths shift to hide her guild’s movements.

## 🏚️ Guild Lair

- **Canopy Sanctum (Virelin):** Central treetop hideout with rope bridges and camouflaged platforms; serves as the main planning chamber.
    
- **Floating Lily Retreat (Koralhame):** Mobile safehouse; guild can vanish mid-meeting as the lilies drift along the Shard-lake.
    
- **The Hollow Root Network:** Subterranean tunnels lined with living roots that store stolen goods, smuggled artifacts, and captured intelligence.
    
- **Spirit Ward Chambers:** Rooms where members perform rituals to “bind” contraband to the land, making it undetectable to outsiders.
