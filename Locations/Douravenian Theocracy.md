## üèûÔ∏è Description

> The Douravenian Theocracy is a towering, austere land of crags, cloud-wrapped monasteries, and Echo-lit sanctuaries. Dominated by fire-colored stone and smoke-veiled valleys, the nation is governed by a **Council of Oracles** said to interpret divine echoes carried on the wind ‚Äî not as messages from gods, but as lingering truths whispered by the world itself.
> 
> Fires are never extinguished in Douravenia ‚Äî from hearth to altar, all flame is considered sacred. These eternal fires are said to burn with the breath of the "Last Harmonist," a mythic pre-Sundering figure who tamed echo-chaos by igniting the first Truth-Flame. Thus, fire and sound are ritualistically entwined in every aspect of Douravenian life.

## üï∞Ô∏è History

- **Founding Myth:** After the Sundering, a voice was heard in the flame atop Mount Ilyen ‚Äî it sang a chord that silenced the storms. Survivors gathered and built their temples around it.
    
- **Key Events:**
    
    - The Synod of the Flame was established to regulate interpretation of divine echoes and prevent heretical tones.
        
    - Successfully repelled a metaphysical incursion by a rogue cell of [[The Cult of the Final Frequency]], who attempted to set the Truth-Flame to discordance.
        
    - Continues to enforce closed borders with [[Merenvegy]] following the "Ashwater Heresy."
