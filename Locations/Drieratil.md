## 🏞️ Description

> Drieratil is a realm of tunnels, pulse-forges, and living stone archives — a civilization carved into the Veil-scarred underlands of Eladris. Its people do not fear Echoes — they **extract** them. Among the lowest peaks and deepest seams, the forgers of Drieratil refine unstable resonance into echo-metals, memory-stone, and vision-glass. Their society thrives beneath the surface, where time hums differently and thought leaves trails.
> 
> Each mine-shrine is part forge, part listening chamber. Echoes are not banished — they are read, recorded, and _cut_ into forms of useful recursion. Drieratili architecture mimics geologic strata: angular, ritualistically reinforced, and inscribed with shifting runes that adapt as their resonance shifts. Citizens are trained from youth to identify unstable feedback, harmonic decay, and “dream-pit” anomalies.

## 🕰️ History

- **Mythic Roots:** Formed by deep-dwellers who, during the Sundering, followed a tremor into the hollow places and found the world still singing.
    
- **Historical Highlights:**
    
    - Developed the **Chrono-Gaunt Codex**, a system of layered resonance-toolcasting used throughout the underlands
        
    - Fought multiple trade wars with [[Kingdom of Quintoria]] over echo-pulse harvesting rights
        
    - Continues to refuse surface rule, even under Begoestian expansion treaties

## 🌟 Key Locations

- **Ulnmark:** The forge-capital. Built around a Resonance Root — a core fragment of pre-Sundering memory.
    
- **Delthold:** Trade-focused chamber city lit by glowstone rivers and chorus-crystals.
    
- **Gravenreach:** A sealed hollow used for Echo refinement and high-risk recursion experiments. Home to the Stone Singers.
    
- **The Hollow Frame:** A collapsed mining district rumored to house Echo spirits that imitate the living.
