## 🏞️ Description

> The Duchy of Drestr is a haunted land of grim pageantry and oaths heavier than steel. Cloaked in ashen forests and cold highlands, Drestr is known for its order of **fate-bound knights** — warriors who seal their souls to Echo-vows in defense of sacred keeps and slumbering shards. The stars over Drestr appear to hang lower, and constellations are often used to track Echo surges or divine shifts in fate.
> 
> Drestric settlements are fortified and cold, their spires carved with anti-resonance glyphs and ancestral names that must never be spoken aloud. Mourning is a public act here; each loss recorded in ritual silence and burned into the bone-wood of memory altars.

The people of Drestr believe that Echoes do not haunt the land — they are the land. Every oath, sin, and vow persists in soil and stone. As such, words carry the weight of permanence, and silence is the highest form of reverence.

## 🕰️ History

- **Founding Legend:** Formed from the exile of oath-breakers who chose to die with their word intact rather than betray their kin during the Sundering.
    
- **Key Historical Events:**
    
    - Fought beside the [[Viagosian Empire]] during the Storm-Harmony Skirmishes, binding oath-light into shared arms
        
    - Lost the fortress of Valegrim when its Echo-warding failed and the garrison relived their final moments for thirty years
        
    - Rescued a fragment of the Veil from a dying Echo-tide, now buried beneath the stones of Hollowfast
