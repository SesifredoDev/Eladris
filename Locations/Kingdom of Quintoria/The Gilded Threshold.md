## 🏙️ Description

> Once a grand war-memorial honoring Pre-Sundering battles, the structure now stands in partial collapse. Fragments of the monument and scattered statues replay battle scenes in disjointed fragments of light, sound, and echo-energy. Temporal anomalies occasionally trap visitors in looping moments of past events. Cracked gold-plated walls shimmer unpredictably, giving the ruin its name.
