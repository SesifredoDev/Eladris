## 📍 Guild Overview

- **Base of Operations:** Hidden in the **echo-fractured zones** of Throsgarde and the ruins around Halvex. Entryways are disguised as broken workshops, abandoned clockwork towers, or warped alleys that shift unpredictably.
    
- **Cover Identity:** Members pose as **mechanic-scribes, scavengers, or relic-repair specialists**. Outsiders believe they are simply salvaging old warforged tech.
    
- **Specialties:**
    
    - Stealing Pre-Sundering relics, warforged parts, and residual echo-tech
        
    - Smuggling or repairing forbidden devices while leaving no temporal traces
        
    - Exploiting time anomalies to “borrow” items and vanish before detection
        
    - Contract heists that require precise timing and manipulation of unstable echo-fields

## 👤 **Guildmaster – Drawfen “Clockhand” Vaeril**

- **Appearance:** Wears a layered cloak of clockwork and rusted plating; fingernails tipped with thin, reinforced daggers for climbing or sabotage.
    
- **Personality:** Calculating, cold, and meticulous. Treats each heist like a mechanical puzzle; occasionally uses echo-anomalies to test loyalty.
    
- **Rumors:** Drawfen is said to have timed a theft perfectly across three fractured hours — stealing the same artifact multiple times from overlapping realities.

## 🏚️ Guild Lair

- **[[The Hollow Forge (Indrellen)]]:** Buried beneath the sealed forge chamber, with shifting corridors and echo-distorted halls. Storage vaults are protected by residual echo-fields.
    
- **[[The Fractured Clocktower (Throsgarde)]]:** Main meeting point, partially functional, partially unstable. Members use temporal loops to vanish or move unseen.
    
- **[[Halvex Alley Network]]:** Maze of collapsed streets and warped pathways; only guild members know which alleys are safe from time-lag anomalies.
