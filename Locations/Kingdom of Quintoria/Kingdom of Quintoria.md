## 🏞️ Description

> Quintoria is a land caught between tradition and fracture — an old kingdom with scarred stone roads, clockwork towers, and echoes of glory from the Pre-Sundering era. It clings to its monarchic lineage like a relic, yet every alley and palace is shadowed by malfunctioning enchantment-tech, rusting echo-engines, and the lingering presence of its once-mighty warforged legions.
> 
> Within its cities, time doesn’t always behave. The streets of Throsgarde stutter occasionally; citizens speak of “echo-lag,” where conversations repeat hours later. The old war towers hum sporadically with residual power, and sometimes act as if they’re still at war.

Despite this, the nobility of Quintoria remains deeply proud. Their knights wear partially active echo-plate, their courts speak in coded protocol, and the monarchy sits atop a throne that remembers every predecessor’s final words — played aloud in a ghostly tone.

## 🕰️ History

- **Pre-Sundering Glory:** Once the seat of arcano-military authority in western Eladris. Known for leading the Warforged Campaigns.
    
- **Aftermath:** Suffered a catastrophic echo-collapse event during the Resonant Reordering. Its attempt to restart warforged production created permanent temporal anomalies in Halvex.
    
- **Recent History:** Formally denounced Echo-tech warfare, yet secretly retains one operational Pre-Sundering forge buried beneath Indrellen.

## 🌟 Key Locations

- **[[Throsgarde]]:** The capital; a city of cracked grandeur. Known for echo-warped courts, failed statues, and the Tower of Sovereign Memory.
    
- **[[Halvex]]:** A time-fractured city near the broken echo-forge. Certain buildings run on ancient momentum — others have vanished entirely.
    
- **[[Indrellen]]:** Rural stronghold; home to the last known sealed forge-chamber. Controlled by the elite Order of the Brazen Mantle.
    
- **[[The Gilded Threshold]]:** A ruined war-memorial structure that randomly replays battle scenes in fragments of sound and light.
