## 🏙️ Description

> Isarret is the **capital jewel of the Deysun desert**, a city sculpted in sand and shadow, arranged in vast concentric circles that mirror both dawn and dusk. At its heart rises the **Temple-Palace of the Circle of Dawns**, a step-pyramid of sandstone and glassstone reminiscent of Mayan temples, each tier dedicated to one of the twelve sacred hours.
> 
> The city thrives around the temple-palace: inner rings are reserved for nobles, echo-scribes, and ritual halls, while the outer rings bustle with merchants, travelers, and desert clans who gather beneath its mirrored walls. At night, braziers filled with resonance-flame bathe the city in alternating hues of gold and violet, casting shifting shadows that seem alive.
> 
> Despite the harsh desert climate, aqueducts carry water from deep-oasis wells, feeding lush courtyards of date palms, cacti, and flowering desert vines. Its architecture blends angular austerity with ritual symbolism — every doorway, street, and archway aligns with the twin thrones’ mirrored cosmology.

## 🕰️ History

- **Founding/Mythology:** Said to be founded where the **first Diarchs split the soul of the Sundering Monarch**, raising the temple-palace as a physical symbol of balance. Legends claim the temple was not built, but “revealed,” emerging from beneath the sand after the first Rite of Dust and Flame.
    
- **Major Events:**
    
    - [[Crystalline Cyclone]] defense led by flame-scribes.
        
    - Coronation of the [[Twin Monarchs of Mosan]].
        
    - The **Silent Procession of Bakou've**, when the heir was taken to the Council of Echoes for the first of his secret rites.
        
- **Current Status:** Prosperous, though tension brews beneath its golden surface as the upcoming **Rite of Dust and Flame** draws diplomats, mystics, and opportunists from across Eladris.

## 🏛️ Court & Political Hooks

1. **The Rite of Dust and Flame**
    
    - The adventurers are invited (or stumble into) the great rite where the **Twin Monarchs** bless the land.
        
    - During the ceremony, a **resonance echo breaks loose**, projecting an image of Bakou’Ve’s _childhood ritual_ for all to see. The Diarchs immediately order silence, but the vision spreads panic. The party must decide whether to suppress, investigate, or weaponize the truth.
        
2. **The Heir’s Shadow**
    
    - Whispers of Bakou’Ve’s disappearance have reached foreign emissaries in the capital. Some suspect he is dead, others claim an **imposter Bakou’Ve** roams the Shardwinds.
        
    - The party must defend his identity, uncover the political actors using his absence as leverage, and perhaps face the literal shadow of Bakou’Ve (an echo spirit formed by his secret rituals).

3. **The Sand-Singers’ Return**
    
    - A sect of hermits arrives in Isarret, chanting harmonic tones said to _command_ the Shardwinds.
        
    - At night, their song summons a **resonance storm** directly over the city. The adventurers must either stop the singers, survive the storm, or learn the true song that calms it.
        
4. **The Mirrored Bazaar Mystery**
    
    - A mirror in the marketplace shows a **murder that hasn’t happened yet**—the Outer Monarch slain during the Rite.
        
    - As suspicion spreads, the PCs must protect Zaharen, prove the vision false, or stop the assassin who seems to know their every move.

5. **The Hidden Hour**
    
    - The temple-palace is built in 12 tiers, each representing an hour. Recently, a secret **13th chamber** was uncovered beneath the throne room, filled with resonance runes matching those in Bakou’Ve’s bones.
        
    - The Diarchs want it sealed; the Council of Echoes wants it studied; foreign agents want it stolen. Only the party can explore it.
        
6. **The Flame-Scribe’s Betrayal**
    
    - A flame-scribe (who transcribes Velmion’s dream-speech) begins inserting **false proclamations** into the rituals.
        
    - The false words accuse Bakou’Ve of treason. The party must track the scribe, uncover who corrupted him, and prevent a false decree from sparking civil strife.

7. **The Bone Runes Stir**
    
    - Strange glyphs begin glowing on Bakou’Ve’s skin when he sleeps in Isarret. Locals whisper that he is _the true Lost One_.
        
    - The party must help him either suppress the runes, channel their power, or survive the inevitable assassins/zealots who come once the rumor spreads.
        
8. **Council of Echoes Summons**
    
    - The Council demands Bakou’Ve return for the **next cycle of rites**—but this time, they intend to “complete” the ritual.
        
    - The adventurers must decide: protect him from his own people, uncover what the council truly intends, or let him embrace the transformation.

- **Intrigue** (false visions, court politics).
    
- **Personal stakes** (Bakou’Ve’s runes, his hidden past).
    
- **Exploration** (secret chambers, desert storms).
