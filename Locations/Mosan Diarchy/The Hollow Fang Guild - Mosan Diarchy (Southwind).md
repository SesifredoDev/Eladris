## 📍 Guild Overview

- **Location:** Isarret, hidden beneath an abandoned spice shop in the outer circle of the capital.
    
- **Hall:** A labyrinthine underground lair built within the fossilized remains of an ancient dragon’s nest. Its walls are ribbed with glassstone veins that hum faintly when weapons are drawn.
    
- **Cover:** A decrepit storehouse that looks long abandoned. The shelves above are layered with sand and fake mold, a deterrent to casual visitors.
    
- **Specialty:** Assassination, counter-assassination, information brokerage, and “knife-law” enforcement for hire.
    

The guild functions as both an **assassins’ order** and an **underground court of blades** — dispensing lethal justice outside the mirrored rulership of the Diarchy.

## 👤 **Guild Leader – Drawfen “The Cloaked Fang”**

- **Appearance:** A lean figure always cloaked in layered shadow-silk. The inside of the cloak bristles with hundreds of hidden knives, arranged like metallic feathers. His fingernails are long, honed into daggers and tipped with blackened steel.
    
- **Eyes:** Piercing amber, rumored to reflect not his soul but the flame-light of the dragon’s bones.
    
- **Personality:** Cold, calculating, but not cruel. He sees assassination as ritual balance — the knife is merely another form of mirrored justice.
    
- **Combat Style:** A blur of steel — fights with cloak-twirling misdirection, using concealed blades like wings. His dagger-fingernails are venom-coated, and he is said to pluck the eyes of enemies with a single hand swipe.
    
- **Reputation:** Some whisper he was once the **lost twin** of a minor Diarchal noble house, though no records prove it. He is known to the city’s underworld as “the Fang That Watches the Throne.”

## 🐉 **The Hollow Fang Guild Hall**

- **The Maw Chamber:** Main gathering hall, shaped from the dragon’s skull. Its teeth act as stone thrones for senior guildmasters.
    
- **The Knife Nest:** Weapon vault where every blade carries a mirrored name, engraved to balance its twin in the guild’s armory.
    
- **The Ash Pools:** Underground pools where assassins meditate in silence, watching their reflections ripple before accepting contracts.
    
- **The Fang Spiral:** A descent tunnel carved from the dragon’s spine, said to hum when trespassers approach.
