## 🏚️ The Phantom Tide Lair

- **[[The Sunken Dock]]:** Main entrance is a collapsed section of Velcairn harbor; tides flush the tunnels daily to hide activity.

- **[[The Glass Repository]]:** Storage for smuggled Echo-glass, documents, and forged seals. Many crates appear ordinary but contain hidden compartments.
    
- **[[The Ironhold]]:** Training area where members practice stealth boarding, underwater infiltration, and knife combat.
