## 🏞️ Description

Drael’Korh is a region of failed ambition and endless decay. Once the beating heart of arcano-tech innovation and warforged manufacture, it is now a vast, rust-choked expanse of **iron bones** and **volcanic scars**. Towering golems — long since driven mad by fractured commands — stagger blindly through the ash, leaving molten footprints in the slag-covered plains. Fire still breathes from deep in the earth, fed by **forgotten forges that never cooled**.

The skies above Drael’Korh are permanently stained **bruised red**, shrouded in smoke from buried furnaces that cough arcane fumes through warped chimneys. Glowing slag rivers wind through hollowed-out cities, and silent machines twitch and hiss with broken rhythm. The air is hot, dry, and electrically charged.

Nothing natural grows here. The only rhythm is the clang of wandering automatons, the hum of resonance-fed generators, and the low groan of wind through collapsed spires.

## ⚠️ Danger Level

- **Extremely High.**
    
- Echo storms are frequent due to unstable arcane feedback loops.
    
- Residual warforged control fields occasionally activate, rewriting short-term memory.
    
- Soul-fracture risks near shattered command nexuses.

## 🎭 Cultural Legacy

Drael’Korh is **the unspoken sin** of the world. No nation claims it. No faith sanctifies it. It was here, many believe, that the first warforged achieved sentience… and where the **Recursive Rebellion** began.

Today, it is:

- Avoided by official mapmakers
    
- Considered cursed in nearly all cultures
    
- Rumored to still _build_ within itself
    

The **[[Archivist Ascendancy]]** denies any active containment projects there — but the presence of Redscript drones and buried echo-barriers says otherwise.

- **The Core Assembly** – A twisted ruin of interlocked engines and burnt sky-bridges, buried in molten slag. Once the largest warforged foundry in the world.
    
- **Vault-Dock 7** – Still sealed. Emits low harmonic pulses in Fire-Machine resonance. Said to house an unactivated _“Titanframe-Class Architect.”_
    
- **The Thought Kiln** – A crumbling basalt tower that once processed echo-core memory units. Haunted by voice-loops and heat mirages.
    
- **The Chain Requiem** – A hill of collapsed automatons linked by spooling cables and shattered soul-cores. Some of them still twitch.
