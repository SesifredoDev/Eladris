## 🏞️ Description

> Cabuero gleams in golden sun and polished stone — a kingdom of glowing courts, pact-law codices, and Echo-templars bound to ancient oaths. The cities are etched with sun-glyphs and law-wards, and every major building bears inscribed contracts blessed by divine echoes. No promise is made lightly, for in Cabuero, every oath becomes **tethered** — a metaphysical binding that resonates across time.
> 
> Cabuero’s strength lies not in force of arms, but in the force of **pactcraft**: agreements brokered with spirits, Echo-constructs, and even the land itself. Their elite Echo-Templars — part jurist, part knight — enforce these bindings, wielding weapons encoded with legal clause-sigils. Their economy thrives on promise-enforced trade and memory-ledger banking.

Though culturally vibrant, Cabuero is rigid beneath the surface. The Law of Layers — a metaphysical structure of contract prioritization — determines even the actions of the crown. The sun is holy here, and each solar eclipse is viewed as a test of a monarch’s pacts with heaven and realm.
