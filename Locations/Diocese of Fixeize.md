## üèûÔ∏è Description

> The Diocese of Fixeize is a narrow strip of land fortified not by stone but by silence, doctrine, and unyielding symmetry. Its cities are geometric marvels ‚Äî gridded streets, mirrored arches, and spotless plazas. There is an oppressive stillness to the land, where even birds fly in patterns, and prayers are whispered rather than sung.
> 
> Echo phenomena are viewed not as curiosities but as **corruptions** ‚Äî spiritual rot that must be contained, cleansed, or seared away. Fixeize is a land of ascetic rituals, echo-exorcists, and memory-purifiers who walk robed in pale cloth, faces marked by ink-seals. The faithful live in submission to fixed truth, scorning illusion, ambiguity, or metaphysical experimentation.

Fixeize maintains tense neutrality with its neighbors, tolerating trade from [[Republic of Begoestia]] only through approved sanctified routes. All texts and cargo are inspected. Those who speak of dreams openly may be detained for ‚ÄúResonance Vetting.‚Äù

## üï∞Ô∏è History

- **Founding Lore:** Formed by exiles from a pre-Sundering metaphysical schism who declared all mutable truth to be heretical. Their founder, Alund Cexil, supposedly walked backward into the Veil and emerged with unbroken memory.
    
- **Key Moments:**
    
    - Instituted the Doctrine of the Fixed Line, a philosophy decreeing that only linear memory ensures moral coherence.
        
    - Burned several Echo-tainted texts received from [[Druvenhal]], igniting decades of scholarly tension.
        
    - Temporarily closed borders with [[Douravenian Theocracy]] over differing flame-interpretation rites, then reopened after a three-day silence pact.

- **The Thirty-Two Courts:** Judicial complexes dedicated to resolving identity disputes ‚Äî often by memory excision or enforced name-sealing.
    
- **Lurvenne:** A lakeside village where voices carry oddly, and sermons are delivered in echo-resistant vaults.
    
- **Feynthal:** A border keep city that trains echo-censors and liturgical archivists. Known for its black-salt gardens and strict light-curfews.
