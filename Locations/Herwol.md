## 🏞️ Description

> Herwol is a realm of frost, stone, and star-guided silence — a glacial expanse where the sun touches the horizon only briefly, and the constellations are watched as divine maps by tribal sky-readers. The land is vast and slow, carved by shifting ice and dream-heavy wind. Communication is largely nonverbal: gestures, snow-runes, and Echo-hums passed between hunters, shamans, and spiritbound seers.
> 
> Great crystalline beasts roam the Pale Steppe, their bodies refracting time and memory. These creatures, revered as messengers of the stars, are bonded to certain Herwol tribes who ride with them across the northern echoes, protecting sacred ley-routes and ancient resonance sinks. Herwol’s people are mobile, enduring, and steeped in cyclic rituals tied to astral memory.

The confederacy is not ruled, but harmonized: each tribe's leader acts in accordance with **Sky-Pattern Concordance**, a divined system of mutual timing and resonance alignment read from the aurora itself. Disputes are settled beneath the **Ice Choirs** — great glacial amphitheaters that echo voices back with layered meanings.

## 🕰️ History

- **Origin Myth:** When the Sundering came, Herwol did not shatter — it _froze_, locking time and memory in deep frost. The first shaman thawed a crystal beast and listened to its mirrored heartbeat to understand what had been lost.
    
- **Key Historical Moments:**
    
    - Fended off an Echo incursion from the shardfall basin now known as the Whisper Crater
        
    - Shared ancestral star-rites with [[Tsardom of Pebopetsia]] long before formal contact
        
    - Rejected integration into the greater shard-world councils, claiming the sky was their only law
