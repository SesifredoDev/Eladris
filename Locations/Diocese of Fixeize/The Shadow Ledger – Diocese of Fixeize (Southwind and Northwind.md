## 📍 Guild Overview

- **Base of Operations:** Hidden beneath the abandoned ossuary of **Feynthal**, accessible via crypt tunnels sealed behind false walls and sanctified chambers. These passages double as secret trade routes and safehouses.
    
- **Cover Identity:** Poses as a **guild of memory-scribes and relic archivists**, offering “Restoration Services” for seized texts, Echo-dossiers, and property records. Outsiders assume the members are clerical archivists or ritual librarians.
    
- **Specialties:**
    
    - Forgery and alteration of sacred records, legal contracts, and relic registries
        
    - Smuggling forbidden texts and heretical artifacts past the strict Echo-vetting authorities
        
    - Contract theft and sabotage of rival Winds’ operations within Fixeize
        
    - Extraction services for politically sensitive prisoners or incriminating evidence

## 👤 **Guildmaster – Drawfen of the Hollow Fang**

- **Appearance:** Wears a dark, multi-layered cloak with hidden blades sewn into the lining. Fingernails are sharpened into small, detachable daggers used for both intimidation and utility. Always moves with deliberate silence.
    
- **Personality:** Cold, calculating, and ritualistic. Drawfen treats theft like a moral contract — every act is weighed, signed in secrecy, and executed with precision.
    
- **Rumors:** Some claim Drawfen maintains simultaneous allegiances with multiple Winds, using Fixeize as a hub for covert negotiation and black-market arbitration.
