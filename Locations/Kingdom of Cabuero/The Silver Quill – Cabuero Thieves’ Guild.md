    - Forging, altering, or nullifying contracts without detection
        
    - Smuggling illegal or forbidden artifacts under the guise of legal transport

## 👤 **Guildmaster – Drawfen Vaeril**

- **Appearance:** Cloak lined with thin daggers; finger-tips sharpened for fine engraving and prying locks. Wears mirrored rings that reflect security glyphs.
    
- **Personality:** Coldly analytical, methodical, and obsessed with leverage; sees every contract as a chessboard.
    
- **Rumors:** Allegedly holds a ledger recording every secret debt in Cabuero — from nobles to templars — giving him ultimate blackmail power.

## 🏚️ Guild Lair

- **[[The Hollow Ledger (Solmara)]]:** Hidden beneath the Grand Archives, reachable through forgotten stacks of contract-scrolls and concealed service corridors. Enchanted glyphs conceal intruders and trap uninitiated thieves in time-delayed echo-loops.
    
- **[[Basquelune Annex]]:** A network of canals and harbor tunnels for discreet movement of smuggled goods, often disguised as nightly contract deliveries.
    
- **[[Halvaran Vaults]]:** Used for storing forged or altered codices, untraceable documents, and confiscated divine-seals; only accessible to fully vetted members.
