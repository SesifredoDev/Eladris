## 🏞️ Description

> The Viagosian Empire is a realm of storms, memory-bound stones, and ancestral echoes — a land where sky and soil both speak. Ruled through ancient oaths and skyborne rites, it is less a single empire and more a **confederation of storm-clans** united under a High Oathstone and the ever-watching sky. When lightning splits the clouds, it is said the ancestors respond.
> 
> Viagosians do not rule from thrones, but from **stone-altars**, where thunder answers challenge and the wind blesses truth. Their military might lies in **skyriders**, oathbound to aerial spirits and riding creatures bred in the upper clouds — from wind-drakes to memory-cranes. Their mystics walk the **Stormpath**, seeking visions in the thunder’s song.

The empire values **legacy** over conquest, **spirit-binding** over raw magic, and believes the Veil is not to be sealed or shattered — but _spoken with_. Their echo-philosophy holds that each person has a mirrored self in stormlight, and choices should honor both.

## 🌟 Key Locations

- **Caerwyn Fell:** Cliff-perched capital built into a cloud-eaten escarpment. Known for its sky-bond rituals and echo-forged spears.
    
- **Stormhold Brae:** A fortress-city where thunder duels determine justice and war-song trials are held before ancestral stones.
    
- **Tyrsolath:** A sacred plateau of mirrors and wind-stones — used only for oaths and funerals. No one speaks above a whisper here.
    
- **The Skyline Vaults:** Hidden wind libraries accessible only during high pressure storms.
