## 📍 Guild Overview

- **Base of Operations:** Hidden beneath the **Hall of Echo-Transcripts** in Veshkar. An abandoned “cool vault” once meant to house failed flame-discs, it is now converted into a secret den masked by false resonance echoes.
    
- **Cover Identity:** An underground network of “emberscribes” who claim to collect the ashes of extinguished ritual flames. In truth, these ashes are used for smuggling, cloaking powders, and coded ink.
    
- **Specialties:** Smuggling relics, echo-forgery (fake flame-discs and transcripts), assassination disguised as divine judgment, and information brokerage through stolen echo-recordings.

## 👤 **Guildmaster – Kaelen Ashfang**

- **Appearance:** A wiry figure wrapped in smoke-colored robes. His mask is shaped like a cracked flame-disc, hiding his mouth entirely.
    
- **Signature Weapon:** Twin shortblades coated in emberdust that leaves glowing cuts like molten cracks.
    
- **Personality:** Charismatic, zealous in his own way — he sees theft as a form of balancing divine injustice. To Kaelen, stealing from the Synod is not rebellion, but sacred correction.
    
- **Rumors:** Once an Echo-Warden acolyte, but exiled when he “heard a false chord” and spoke it aloud. Many whisper his expulsion was political, not divine.
    
- **Calling Card:** Always leaves a small circle of extinguished ash where his mark has fallen — a flame deliberately snuffed.

## 🏚️ The Cinder Veil’s Lair

- **[[The Ash Chamber]]:** Main hall where blackened braziers glow with smothered flames, kept low to avoid echo detection.
    
- **[[The Ember Archive]]:** A collection of stolen flame-discs and echo-crystals, some containing words the Synod never wanted spoken.
    
- **[[The Smolder Paths]]:** Secret tunnels filled with smoke that confuse both sight and sound; guild members navigate by patterned clicks on glassstone walls.
    
- **[[The Silent Pyre]]:** An execution pit where traitors are burned without flame — asphyxiated in smoke until their last echo fades.
