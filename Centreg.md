## 🛡️ Description

> The **Centreg** is an independent investigative corps of scholars, combat-trained arcanists, survivalists, and memory-specialists employed by sovereigns and ruling bodies across Eladris. Though not beholden to any one nation, the Centreg operates lawfully and transparently within each domain’s local customs — a rare balance of autonomy and civic trust. They are called not to fight wars, but to solve _echo-crises_.
> 
> Their primary role is to investigate emergent phenomena tied to unstable resonance nodes, unregistered Echo activity, Veil disturbances, or anomalous temporal distortions. Part scholar, part mercenary, part priest, each Centreg cell adapts its methods to suit the land it operates in. They are **respected**, **unpolitical**, and often **left alone** — regarded as a necessary presence in a world still learning to survive its own fragmentation.

Most members are known simply as **Tregets**, derived from an old term meaning "treader" — those who walk upon the edges of what is known.

## 🕰️ History

- **Formation Date:** Shortly after the **First Echo War**, in response to the lack of coordinated response to planar cross-bleeds and resonance catastrophes.
    
- **Founders:** Originally organized by surviving field-magi from [[Drieratil]], a philosopher envoy from [[Blumengenia]], and a neutral Begoestian archivist named Veln Corrin.
    
- **Notable Contributions:**
    
    - Prevented the spread of the Hollow Tide in the fractured marshes of [[Merenvegy]]
        
    - Identified a silent resonance surge in the Vault Rim of [[Druvenhal]]
        
    - Maintained neutrality during the Echo-Census War, mediating several ceasefire rituals

## 🌐 Structure & Operations

- **Autonomous Cells:** Each cell is composed of 3–6 Tregets, chosen for complementary skillsets and local knowledge.
    
- **Regional Alignment:** Operate under agreements with local rulers; legal to the laws of the land they serve.
    
- **Command Model:** Each region hosts a Centreg Liaison — usually a retired Treget or appointed Echo-specialist who oversees operations.
    
- **Tools of Office:**
    
    - **Veil Rods** — enchanted resonance detectors
        
    - **Echo Seals** — writs of authority recognized in most major shard-domains
        
    - **Memory Ink** — for secure incident reports and historical tethering

## 📝 Notes

- Centreg missions range from artifact retrieval to Veil-collapse prevention, dream-hazard containment, and inter-shard resonance synchronization.
    
- Though respected, Centreg operatives are watched carefully. Any abuse of their writ can lead to total revocation of regional access.
    
- Each member carries a fragment of Echo-glass — both a tool and a rite of passage.
    
- No Treget has ever been allowed to rise to political office in any nation, by informal agreement — a measure of the order’s enduring neutrality.
