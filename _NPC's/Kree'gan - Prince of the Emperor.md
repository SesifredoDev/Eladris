## 🎭 Personality & Motivations

- **Core Traits:** Poised, eerily calm, silver-tongued, meticulous in ritual etiquette. His voice is said to carry a _harmonic undertone_ that unsettles listeners.
    
- **Flaws & Secrets:** Blind since childhood — his hollowed sockets are said to resonate with faint tonal light when he invokes the Final Frequency. In truth, his blindness is the result of self-inflicted ritual, aligning his body as a “living chamber” for resonance.
    
- **What Does He Want?** Kree’gan longs to be both the savior and the undoing of his people: to usher the Tiseresch into what he calls the _“Mercy of Unison”_ while preserving the empire’s name eternally within the Final Tone.

## 📖 Backstory & Role in the Story

Kree’gan was born the halfling son of the Emperor’s last concubine, long dismissed as a ceremonial union. Though minor by blood, imperial bureaucracy elevated him as **Prince of the Emperor** through ancient rite — a symbolic bridge between empire and common people.

From a young age, he was obsessed with the **Soul-Lattice Census**, claiming he could _“hear the voices”_ beyond the records. At thirteen, he put out his own eyes before the Ivory Decree Vault, swearing that he saw too many selves at once. Instead of exile, the Spirit-Scribes recorded his act as an omen.

In adulthood, he became one of the **Secret Four** within the Cult of the Final Frequency, known in whispers as the **“Prince of Hollow Law.”** To the empire, he is a frail but dutiful prince, a living reminder of continuity. To the cult, he is a visionary who merges law and collapse — binding civic decree to the coming dissolution.

His double-life lets him leak civic rites, echo-chimes, and harmonic decrees directly into the Spiral Choir’s archives. Many scholars fear it is only through him that the cult has learned to weaponize law-tones.

## 📝 Notes

- His hollow eyes sometimes glow faint amber during civic ceremonies — the official excuse is “ancestral fire,” though cultists call it the **“Flicker of Collapse.”**
    
- Keeps a personal choir of blind children in Yuegai, who memorize laws by echo, never by script.
    
- Some believe he is already partially dissolved into resonance — his shadow sometimes flickers half a second behind his movement.
