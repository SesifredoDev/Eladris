- The Song of the Grove may be **sentient**, and some say it mourns a memory that doesn’t belong to Virterra.
    
- One of the Glimmerrest Paths once appeared in [[Druvenhal]] — and then retreated violently, leaving three archivists asleep for a week.
    
- A seed from the Heart Tree of Virelin was stolen during a failed expedition by [[The Cult of the Final Frequency]] — it now hums discordantly in [[The Spiral Choir]].
