## ⚔ 

Designed for: **3 Level 8 PCs (Wizard, Paladin, Monk) + 1 Level 10 Guest**  
Plus: **Marrow-of-Glass (dual-player Shardbound Merfolk)** already active.

This is a **Deadly + narrative boss encounter** intended to feel overwhelming but survivable through positioning, action economy management, and Volaris’ Scion moment.

# ⚖ Encounter Balance Analysis

### Total Enemy Weight:

- Voltus (CR 11 Elite)
    
- 2–3 Aegis (CR 5 each)
    
- Marrow-of-Glass (CR ~9)
    
- Choir interference optional
    

This is **intentionally overwhelming** unless:

- The party splits threats
    
- Paladin locks Voltus
    
- Monk pressures Marrow
    
- Wizard controls Aegis
    
- Volaris uses Scion at climax
    

---

# 💥 Phase Escalation Structure

### Phase 1 (Rounds 1–2)

Voltus stays defensive.  
Aegis pressure frontline.  
Marrow plants Seeds.

---

### Phase 2 (Round 3+)

Voltus uses Globe of Invulnerability.  
Marrow detonates Seeds.  
Aegis Mana Surge.

Party should feel squeezed.

---

### Phase 3 (Ritual Climax)

When Han calls for energy burst:

**Volaris Reaction Event:**

- He may use the Scion.
    
- Absorb the burst.
    
- Gain 30 temp HP.
    
- Restore one 4th-level spell slot.
    
- Emit radiant shockwave (20 ft, 3d10 radiant).
    

This shifts momentum.

---

# 🧠 Tactical Synergy

- Lotus Fragrance → harder perception
    
- Seeds → punish clustered play
    
- Gravity Lock → keep monk from skirmishing
    
- Counterspell → protect Marrow bloom
    
- Aegis Intercept → protect Voltus
    

They fight intelligently.

---

# 🔥 Optional Twist

When Voltus drops below 40 HP:

> “You think this makes you free?”

He attempts to **plane shift Volaris back to the Astral** (contested Arcana check vs Volaris).
