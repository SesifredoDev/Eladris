## Backstory 
You never knew a permanent home; the road was your only constant companion. This nomadic existence is all you'd ever known. For as long as you can remember, 
you traveled with a group of vagabonds, primarily dwarves, learning the rhythms of life on the move.

Once a bit older, your path intertwined with that of an older, seasoned bard who became your mentor. Traveling with them, 
you didn't just learn the melodies and verses of a bard; you learned the subtler arts of reading people and employing the occasional trick or minor hoax to ensure your survival on the road. 
Moving from tavern to tavern, you quickly grasped the bard's philosophy: "Why look for truth in a ballad? Truth is one thing, poetry another."
and understood that "ballads were not written to be believed, but to move their audience." A ballad, you realized, was a versatile tool in your arsenal, capable of entertaining a crowd for coin or subtly manipulating them to your advantage. 
As your mentor often said, you weren't lying, merely "embellishing, and there's a difference."

Eventually, as you became more proficient with the lute and the performance, your mentor recognized a deeper potential within you and began to show you how to utilize and hone innate magical abilities. 
This newfound magic, however, drew unwelcome attention. A group of zealots from an anti-magic cult caught onto your emerging powers and sought to hunt you and your mentor down to make an example of you. 
During a desperate escape, you were separated from your mentor and tragically lost a precious blue pearl.

Now, your lute is one of your few remaining connections to your lost mentor. It was a gift from them, with intricate runes or wording inscribed upon it in a language the other players might not understand. 
These runes appear serious or profound and are repeatedly brought up in descriptions of the character or actions, but in truth, they conceal a rude joke or an inside insult

Your journey is now driven by the need to find answers. A Small Milestone on this path would be finding the lost blue pearl, 
gaining another tangible connection to your mentor and potentially uncovering clues about their whereabouts or fate that could link into the current story you find yourself in.

The Large Milestone is the eventual discovery of your mentor's fate. Perhaps they were captured by the cult or even given over as a prisoner or slave to a different faction or group that ties into the larger narrative of the campaign. 
Alternatively, you might discover evidence that your mentor died, leading to a potential quest for vengeance against the group responsible for your separation and their demise.

Physical traits:, A blonde elf woman with striking blue eyes, a trait that earned her the nickname "Little Eye" from her mentor and possibly other travelers who knew her from your earlier days with the dwarven group. 
As has been observed, "For in her agreeable and pretty, but otherwise unremarkable, little face shone a huge, beautiful, shining, dark blue eye, which riveted the gaze. One has no way of detaching one's gaze from it." 
The nickname "Little Eye" doesn't imply her eye is small, but rather refers to the fact that her unruly curls have a tendency to fall over one of your captivating blue eyes, often hiding it from view.
