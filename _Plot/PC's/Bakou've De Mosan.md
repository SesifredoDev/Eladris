## Backstory
In the quiet hush of the Mosan night, beneath the eclipsed moon and among the whispering dunes of the Deysun, a child was born into contradiction. Bakou've De Mosan — son of Velmion, the Inner Sovereign, one of the two mirrored rulers of the Mosan Diarchy — entered the world not with a cry, but with silence so dense the ceremonial flame went still. The air rippled. The midwives blinked, and the world around the birth chamber had subtly shifted.

The child was not right. His form bent strangely at first glance, bones unfamiliar, the sand beneath him glassed from a burst of resonance. Velmion, who rarely broke his tranquil silence, spoke only once that night: "We must go. Now."

Thus, before his first breath could echo across Isarret, Bakou've was spirited away under veil and starlight. With his wife and newborn in tow, Velmion walked the hidden paths into the custody of [[The Council of Echoes]]. What occurred in that cave beneath the shifting ley-lines is known only to the council and the sovereign. But when they returned, the child was whole — seemingly normal — save for something faintly shimmering in his skin under moonlight. Something carved.

The ritual was secret, sacred, and essential. Every two lunar cycles, the boy was brought to a still-water cave near Kharvun. There, amid mirrored stone and flickering rune-fire, they performed rites said to be blessings from his ancestors. The boy, unaware of his origin, believed this was tradition — the cost of being royal. He accepted the prayers, endured the chants, and watched runes swirl through the water like stories never told aloud.

As he grew, so did his discomfort. Lessons on diplomacy and prophecy felt like weighted ropes. The watchful eyes of both his father figures, Zaharen and Velmion, were gentle, but constant — and tight. Their protectiveness, born of fear and duty, smothered more than it shielded.

Bakou've’s magic came strangely. He didn’t spark like a sorcerer, nor weave like a wizard. Instead, it came like water rushing past his legs, waiting to be redirected. He sensed magic in the air, in the stone, in the breath between sentences. He touched a spell and felt where it wanted to go, not what it meant. The tutors were puzzled. The books disagreed with him. And he with them.

At sixteen, he was given a province to oversee. A silver circlet. A court of his own. But with it came the same cave. The same rituals. The same ghostly feeling that none of this was _his_. So one night, before the next cycle, he packed nothing but a coat and a crooked dagger, and slipped away from the mirrored halls of his lineage.

He crossed the sands in silence, hidden in the Shardwinds, where time folds like silk. He arrived in Republic of Begoestia not as a prince, but as a stranger — small, halfling, quick-witted, and tired. There, he signed with the [[Centreg]], an order of field operatives and Echo-phenomena investigators.

He told them his name was Bakou, son of a desert priest. It was enough. His hands were steady, his instincts strange but useful. And somewhere between the contracts and Veil anomalies, he began to feel... free.

Sometimes, late at night, cups fall without reason. People vanish mid-step. The stars rearrange for a breath. And something inside him listens to a silence deeper than the desert.

He doesn't know he is a miracle preserved by broken reality. That the runes in his bones hum when he sleeps. That his magic doesn’t come from within — it _seeps_, from where he almost was, and what he might still become.

But he knows one truth:

He is tired of being protected.
