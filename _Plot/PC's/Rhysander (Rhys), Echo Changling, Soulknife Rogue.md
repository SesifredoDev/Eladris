## Backstory
Some 27 years ago a freak Echo surge wracked the back ally streets of Cindralune, sending ripples through reality that rocked even the floating opera houses far above. In the aftermath of this surge Emet Selch, owner of the backstreet tavern the Harlequin’s Hideaway, came across a strange infant seemingly abandoned in the chaos. The child was a porcelain white, with faint lines ever swirling across its skin, like ink in water and eyes of pitch black with radiant purple iris. Alone and sure to die, Emet took the child back to the Harlequin’s Hideaway where he would raise him in the community of street urchins and back ally folk that frequented the establishment, naming the child Rhysander or Rhys for short. 

As he aged it became apparent that Rhys had the ability to alter his form, warping reality around himself to mimick the appearances of those around him. He was a curiosity for sure, but was never shunned or dismissed as different. If anything Emet made a point of ensuring he was afforded the same treatment as any other outcast that frequented the Harlequin. Still, outside the safety of the tavern and surrounding area Rhys would adopt a form more seen more frequently on the streets, though those closets to him knew it was only a facade. 

Rhys grew up picking the pockets of Cindralune nobility and leaping across the rooftops of the city with friends as they fled from the guards. The Harlequin remained his home, the patrons his community that, although rough, always looked out for him. His strange appearance and abilities became common place for the people around him, dismissed as normal, and this remained the way of things until he was 15 years old. 

One day Rhys attempted to rob a noble on the streets of one of the more affluent areas of Cindralune. A guard caught him by sheer chance and knocked him to the floor, breaking his focus on maintaining his form. Rhys’ true was displayed in broad daylight for all to see before he and his friends quickly fled back the the Harlequin for safety. That night, a group of people broke in and began setting the place allight, beating anymore who tried to flee. The group demanding the location of the “shifter child”, ranting about frequencies and finality as they cut people down. Rhys caught a glimpses of his friends and family being slaughtered as Emet rushed him to the upper floors of the Harlequin, fending off attackers as they went. Barricaded in one of the upper floors Emet thrust a porcelain Harelquin mask into Rhys’ hands before gripping him by the shoulders and saying “Flee boy! You trust in you and yours only and you flee!” Those were Emet’s last words before he shoved Rhys through a window and set him tumbling down to the alley below, turning to face the attackers as the Harlequin burned around them.

Rhys escaped and never heard from anyone he knew again. In the following years were rough. Never staying in one place too long, he travelled around Thorinthia, passing as one race or another, surviving by thieving and the occasional bit on assassination if he agreed that the contract deserved to die. Life was a constant and aimless wander until recently when Rhys heard whispers of a group calling themselves the Cult of the Final Frequency, and his need for revenge compelled him to investigate.

## Verses
He wears a thousand borrowed skins,  
a shifting mask of truth and lies;  
the shard of god that walks in him  
remembers still where silence cries.  
The hearth he fled yet calls his name,  
a hollow fire, a broken throne—  
come home, come home, the shadows sing,  
or find the dark that makes you whole.

Beneath each mask, another lies,  
A god unshaped, with fractured eyes.  
The shards of heaven bleed through bone—  
Come claim the void, come find your home.
