## Backstory
Once was a protégé of an Quintorian General, Zholdra studied and learnt from his mentor, who acted as a father figure to the Young goliath who's clan was slaughtered by a group attempting to bring back a warforged from a tomb which the goliath clan was on top off. During the destruction of his clan the young Zholdra who was 7 hid until he saw them. Knights glistening in Echo-Plate armour, riding atop of Mounts and the one leading them, a man with black steel and a halberd larger than the horse he rode. After the battle had finished between the Knights and the warforged revitalists, the large and daunting man clad in black echo plate walked to Zhondra and simply picked him up and held him, as the last surviving goliath his family was dead, torn up and and a burning memory cemented itself unto Zhondra, the pain and suffering still brought by the rotten warforged and those that have their sympathy, and the clear memory of being saved by the one man who came to help. Fierce and brutal training surrounded the younger years of Zhondra's life, always supervised by Rathner, his savouir who turned out to be a general of the Quintorian General, an influential figurehead of the military and also in the courts. Rathner often would train Zhondra in matters of the blade and tought him everything he needed to know so that he would never be as defenceless as he was that horrid day. Rathner would also teach young Zhondra of the horrors of the warforged. After a few years Zhondra would become one of his mentors most trusted lieutenants, commanding a small but specalised force of Quintorian elites, completing any mission given to them by Rathner personally. They were off the books and claimed no glory but there missions were often instrumental in the continued grandness of the Kingdom of Quintoria, at least that's what Zhondra was led to believe

During a mission to assassinate a leader of a group of warforged revitalists, something went wrong and the target saw Zhondra before he could bring down the blade against his neck and the leader shouted out begging for his life and promising he would soon find another warforged for Rathner, Stunned and shocked Zhondra grabbed the mans skull with his bare hands and shouted and demanded that he explain himself. The leader of the revitalists screamed in pain saying how he would soon find a warforged for rathner and that he would fail him no longer, filled with rage with what he said Zhondra in a bout of rage and betrayal crushed the mans skull with his hands. Zhondra quickly searched through the targets belongings finding letters and notes from him and rathner and stating how rathner needed to find a warforged to bring back the glory of the Warforged armies of Quintoria.

Flooded with rage and pain, Zhondra pushed on and quickly hid the notes he had found, tucking them in his plate, just before the rest of his team arrived. As the rest of his elite team arrived they looked at Zhondra with suspicion and distrust and it was at this moment that Zhondra realised, they weren't his team and it wasn't him who they were loyal to, it was his mentor, his adoptive father, the man who he trusted with everything, and then he realised their true mission wasn't to fight with him and work with him, it was to watch him, to make sure he never found out, that Rathner himself was the one leading the warforged revitalists, and all this time Zhondra was simply helping him, taking out targets that got in rathners way, or had failed him. And as he realised this, his team took out their blades, and Zhondra knew that they were now meant to end him. Using the powers of the cloud Giants, Zhondra used a cloud step to gain distance and escape the building and Zhondra just ran, using everything in his power to escape and eventually he found a horse and rode as far as he could, filled with pain, betrayal and a lingering thought, did rathner plot his own families death, did he send the revitalists to his clans home and was saving him simply covering evidence and appearing as a saviour and honourable knight to the rest at court.



### passage
The jungle quiets as you kneel by the stream, cupping the cool water into your hands. For a moment, the world is still—just the rush of current over stone, just the weight of your breath.

Then you see it.

Your reflection stares back from the trembling surface: a soldier’s face carved from years of war, eyes that once believed in justice now ringed with something darker. Behind your own features, the water wavers—shapes shifting—until you almost swear you see him. Rathner’s face, proud and commanding, watching you from the depths. For an instant, it looks as though he stands over your shoulder, hand resting on you like the day he first lifted you from the ashes.

But the current pulls, and the image twists. Blood spreads across the water, rippling outward, not just the blood of your enemies but the blood of your brothers-in-arms, your own family of soldiers—cut down by your hand. Their eyes stare back at you in the water’s shifting mirror, not accusing, not forgiving, just _there._

And in that endless, distorted reflection, you cannot tell anymore whether it was Rathner’s hand that raised the blade… or your own.

The jungle wind stirs, and the surface shatters. All that remains in the stream is your reflection—alone.
