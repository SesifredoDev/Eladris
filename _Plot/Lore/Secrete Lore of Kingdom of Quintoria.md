## 🧩 Hidden Lore (For GMs Only)

- The ghost-voice in the throne may not be a memory at all — some scholars suspect it is a fragment of a failed [[The Council of Echoes]] merging.
    
- The forge beneath Indrellen houses a dormant **echo-engine** capable of producing "conceptual warforms" — constructs designed around symbolic archetypes rather than physical blueprints.
    
- Quintoria's ruling bloodline has a subtle echo-defect: occasionally remembering alternate decisions, leading to dangerous inconsistencies in governance.
    
- A sealed directive from the early warforge days exists somewhere in Halvex — its activation would resume hostilities against a foe that no longer exists.
