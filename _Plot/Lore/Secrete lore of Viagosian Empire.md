[[Viagosian Empire]]

## 🧩 Hidden Lore (For GMs Only)

- The Viagosian Stormpath leads to a semi-stable Echo-node known as the **Howling Hollow**, where stormlight mirrors show truths from _unspoken timelines_.
    
- Some suspect a **Council of Echoes** presence resides in Stormhold Brae — or perhaps an ancestral soul that never resolved.
    
- The current High Oathstone hums during planar shifts — its tone has changed three times in a century, each time preceding a metaphysical crisis.
    
- A Viagosian relic — the Sky-Bound Tear — is missing. Believed to have been taken into [[The Spiral Choir]] after a false treaty.
