### **Hour 1: The Descent into the Lotus**

- **The Welcome:** The party descends through the Deep Pelagic Expanse. The NPC guard leads them to the **Pearlwake Pavilion**.
-
- **The Introduction of Han:** Han Qing-jao is already there, dismissively investigating the coral structures. She recognizes Volaris as a potential "asset" due to his unique mana signature.
    
- **The Guest Guards:** Marrow-of-Glass (the two-player Merfolk) introduces themselves.
    - The guards use their **Lotus Fragrance** passive; describe the party feeling an "overwhelming sense of calm" (Id like Max and Adam to say things like "Its just extremely chill" or "A calm emanates of me" in related descriptions.

- **The Scry Payoff:** Confirm Voltus is indeed near the **Gilded Core**, but the temporal distortion makes his movements look like stuttering echoes.


### **Hour 2: The Gentle Drift (Exploration & Roleplay)**

- **City Tour:** The guards lead the party through the **Outer Rings**. Point out that no structures show decay and citizens cannot remember "last year".

- **Interaction:** Han pulls the party aside. She reveals her true mission: she believes Nisrith’s shard is "festering" and needs to be "Set" using the **Setting Shard Sanction**.

- **The Threat:** The guest guards begin "Subtle Sabotage" or "Siren's Lullaby" on the party’s NPC allies to keep them from leaving.

### **Hour 3: The Breaking Points**

- **The "Break" Event:** A local NPC experiences "The Break"—sudden grief and awareness of the centuries passed. The Guest Guards must "gently reassign" (neutralize) them.
    
- **Han’s Explination:** Han explains the "Setting of the Shard" Steps, talking about "A being, Object or Place from both worlds". And the other related information.
    
- **Volaris’s Discovery:** Volaris realizes the **Arcs Infinium** power might be related to these resonant nodes. (Hopefully. Please Michael!)

### **Hour 4: The Heist of the Gilded Core**

- **Infiltration:** The party must enter the **Gilded Core** where the Resonant Shard floats.
    
- **Hazard:** The **Choir of Tides** is performing harmonic rituals. Anyone standing too close begins to lose track of time.
- **The Guards' Betrayal:** If the party tries to disturb the Shard, the Guest Guards' **Id (The Shard)** takes control. They begin using **Fracture-Spike** and **Narcotic Bloom**, attempting to plant "Seeds" in the party.

### **Hour 5: The Ritual – Setting the Shard**

- **The Reveal:** A rift tears open in the palace dome, as Volaris glows slightly in outline.
    
- **Enter Voltus Tyrval:** Volaris's brother, **Voltus**, descends with a squad of **Zenith Aegis**.
-
- **Ending Note:** Voltus stands amidst the chaos of the "Set" city, arrogant and decadent. He looks at Volaris and the now-glowing Scion.
    
    - _Voltus:_ "You always did have a knack for finding things that don't belong to you, little brother. Hand over the Scion, and I might let these fish-folk live through the withdrawal".

- **The Setup:** Han Qing-jao begins the ritual on Bokuve.
    
    - **Step 1:** Force Bokuve into a "crazed state" (Resonance).+
    -
    - **Step 2:** Combat Encounter. The party must defend Han and Bokuve from the Choir of Tides and the Shard-Bound Guards for 5 rounds.
        
- **The Climax:** Han calls for a "great burst of energy".
    
- **Volaris’s Moment:** Volaris uses the **Scion** (his father's device) to intercept the energy. Instead of the energy setting the veil, Volaris channels the **Radiant Mana** into his own reserves/the Scion.

### **Hour 6: The Arrival of the Zenith Aegis**

- **The Success:** The Shard "Sets." For a moment, the temporal distortion snaps. The city feels the weight of a thousand years all at once. Lets see the withdrawal start!
