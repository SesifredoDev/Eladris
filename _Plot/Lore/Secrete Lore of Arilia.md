## 📍 [[Kingdom of Arilia]]


- The **Whispering Tone** is not natural — it’s a residual field created by a buried fragment of the same Veinstone at the heart of [[Nauvein]]. Arilia is unknowingly tuned.
    
- The Arilian crown contains a sliver of Echo-caged memory from the first [[Vessel of Collapse]]. It watches. It remembers.
    
- Arilia once attempted to seal a portion of the Veil permanently in its mountains, but the effort failed — leaving a thin scar now used by certain [[Council of Echoes]] agents.
    
- Trade with [[Merenvegy]] has quietly increased through indirect channels. The crown denies this.
    
- One of the Twilight Cairns once appeared inside the garden of the [[Arch-Lexicon Thariel Vos]] — and was never acknowledged publicly.
