## 🔮 Description

The Looming Cord is a length of iridescent thread that shifts color based on proximity to planar instability. When held, it feels weightless, but it hums faintly when stretched across space — resonating in tones that can only be described as “truth-adjacent.” To the untrained, it appears as a beautiful cord of shifting silk. To a Veilbinder, it is a living sensor, attuned to the thinning of the Veil and the collapse of boundaries between identity, time, and place.

When uncoiled, it maintains perfect tension, even when draped across air — and it is said to “lean” toward places where the world has begun to forget itself.

## ⚡ Magical Properties

- **Effect:**  
    Detects planar instability, Echo drift, or Veil-thinning in a local radius. When suspended in stillness, the cord aligns toward the nearest metaphysical fracture or unreal presence. In deep meditation, it can allow the user to “feel” where the world is coming undone.
    
- **Activation Method:**  
    Passive while held or anchored; advanced use involves synchronizing breath with its harmonic rhythm.
    
- **Drawbacks/Limitations:**
    
    - Overexposure can lead to echo hallucinations or emotional feedback loops if used too long in unstable areas.
        
    - Cannot function during major Echo Events without grounding from a Thread-Anchor Relic.
        
    - Will knot itself violently if misused near artificially sustained planar gates.
        
- **Recharge/Uses:**  
    Passive — constantly attuned unless ritually silenced. Requires ritual re-harmonization under moonlight every 30 days.
