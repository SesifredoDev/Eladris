## üîÆ Description

Sigilbrand Seals are rectangular metal blocks with a flat stamping surface covered in dormant rune-patterns. When pressed against a text, object, or surface bearing unstable resonance, the seal **brands** it with a containment glyph that locks its magical properties, halts Echo recursion, or renders dangerous information inert.

Each Seal has a distinct identity, with complex mechanical internals that respond only to its registered wielder‚Äôs mental imprint. Some elite versions can alter their branding effect depending on the stability of the knowledge or entity encountered.

## ‚ö° Magical Properties

- **Effect:**  
    Brands dangerous texts, surfaces, or artifacts with a suppression glyph that halts arcane recursion, temporal bleed, or Echo-based illusion. Can also be used to seal minor planar breaches or memory-encoded scrolls.
    
- **Activation Method:**  
    Held firmly in hand while reciting a classification phrase in Inkguard protocol sigil-script.
    
- **Drawbacks/Limitations:**
    
    - Cannot affect items above a certain Resonant threshold without backup (e.g., Thread-Anchors or Soulstitch Wards).
        
    - Branding living beings is strictly forbidden (though it has been done, under classified circumstances).
        
    - Misuse can trigger reverse feedback ‚Äî destabilizing the knowledge further instead of sealing it.
        
- **Recharge/Uses:**  
    Can be used 3 times before needing to be ritually re-inked in a Redscript chamber.
